363,what happened? this used to be a premium app. like many developers  they decided to fix things that weren't broken:  i'm assuming this is done to remain relevant. my biggest complaint is the loss of page flipping after the last update. why wasn't this checked before its release? i also notice that many web pages have trouble loading onto pocket. i continue to receive error messages claiming unable to sync. i'd like to give the app a higher rating  but not until these issues are ironed out.,BUG

435,app is slow it it not well organized the categories like shooters there is only one witch is incorrect and its slow it freezes scrolling is glitchy etc.,PERFORMANCE
436,there is room for improvement... the good thing  it lets you know when your moga (pro) has been connected to your android device and it displays current games that support the controller. the bad thing: a.its interface. it's boring  even my 14yr old cousin can make it look like tegra zone-based stylish themed or better. b.the bluetooth connection. when i'm using the game  the controller loses the connection with it for too long so i have to press the moga button and try to reconnect;or it happens for a few seconds and while i'm using the controller  my notification keeps showing the controller has been connected to my tablet. c.the moga pivot connects the controller to the android device  but why on earth does it not display the controller battery life? how much longer can my controller's built-in battery last? it should let me know. d.just let me know whenever a new game has support for the controller. i'm talking about pivot running in the background  self-updating its catalog and pushing a notification warning me a new game has entered the 'supported games' list. it'd be great. e.sometimes the controller takes too long to connect. what's with the hold up? please fix these issues. they are worth a new update.,USABILITY

1368,major bug i had triggers and gas systems for all my guns. the game removed them from all of my guns and when i try to re-equip them  the game lags and takes them off again. fix please!,BUG
1369,five star potential love the game  but the thing is incredibly memory and $  greedy with updates. i don't get why it requires a full install with new updates. no other app does this. have to uninstall for each one thus losing all in app purchases. big problem. especially as you have to shell out to unlock all features after you pay for the app. and developers have refused to reimburse. after two tries (costing me about $15 each) i'm not updating any more. it's good but not $40 good.,PERFORMANCE

1590,this app's access is incredibly scary a well known and extremely trusted antivirus app has thrown great caution to downloading this particular app. what this app has access to is incredibly scary. do your homework and make sure that you understand what it is you are agreeing to. in the meantime i would request that the owner of this app explain why they need the level of access that they need. i'm curious to know what type of data mining might be going on because this app has the potential to store and change your personal text data.,SECURITY

1602,good solid performance affordable excellent 98% of the time. . still freezes occasionally .. just after you have gone wrong and need its help!,BUG
1603,the best satnav i have ever used i used this for over a year now and absolutely love it. some many trips some lasted weeks (!) and apart from the initial bugs it never missed a beat. i read that some people with the galaxy s2 complained about the app draining the battery faster than it is charged... all i would say to them is buy a genuine samsung charger! not only will it be able to keep up but will even charge it to full. this app is the best value for money satnav!,ENERGY
1604,only one issue but it is major one the app would be great but it is memory intensive and does not allow the option to store the maps to an external memory card (maps can only be installed on built in memory). my previous copilot versions allowed maps on external cards so i was surprised and disappointed.  my 8 gb internal was not enough and i have 32 gb external available.,FEATURE
1605,alright  navigation but the real drawback it's the fact that customers with acer and samsung devices with internal and external memory will find it most annoying that the maps cannot be moved to external memory without rooting and manipulating their phones. i asked for support and got a email back suggesting i contact samsung  despite having specified acer as my phone  so not only is there no solution but also no interest assisting customers. it seems a rather simple fix  to select storage like other apps address this problem.,FEATURE
1606,the best! was using sygic for a while but got fed up with the amount and frequency of issues it gave me. copilots maps and choice of route are much better as well as using less battery (amongst other good things...),OTHER
1607,excellent app hi folks  i do not understand why everyone is complaining about this app. it does work as it suppose on my nexus 4 without any issues.,OTHER
1608,great app update: app causes very high battery use if you do not have a data connection  no way to stop this? was going to rely on the app for touring europe but not now until the problem is fixed! galaxy s2.,ENERGY
1609,beware of this company!!! in good faith i bought this application. it performed very poorly on my google nexus 7. the application looks like it is written for a phone  not a tablet. the battery drain is huge and the spoken directions are chronically late even after making adjustments in the setting. within 24 hours  i wrote co-pilot expressing my difficulties and requested a refund. all i have gotten is recitation of eula terms. no offer to fix my issues  no willingness to refund me an let me depart quietly.  stay away....there must be better apps than this one,PERFORMANCE
1610,fast and good good precise and fast with alternate routes that others don't have it.good indications with clean display.better than every other nav app .the big problem is that i want to have the maps folder on the external memory of the device and not on the internal memory.please fix this and is the perfect navigation app.,FEATURE
1611,very good but crashes occasionally even though i'm on i9305 and memory is not an issue...,BUG
1612,excellent app! i have tried sygic  navigon  wyse  shturmann  navitel  igo  ndrive on android and tomtom on windows mobile. maps are detailed and acceptably fresh  routing is almost very good 4 of 5. app usability and features 5 of 5. ease of use 4 of 5 (because of features). battery usage is fine  seems to be better than sygic. there are few things to make it the best: 1. - disable snapping to road  as in walking mode you are alwayse snapped to road  may be after 3 meters it should be detached from main road. same applies to driving in places where are new roads  so navigator goes crazy :) 2. - pinch zoom and map panning should be a bit more subjectively fast (sgs2) at least in 2d view. 3. i think country should be selected first as in sygic then city  currently you choose city and there is big list of ones. as well as previous street names should be remembered as cities are  same applies to street numbers  better to remember combinations for easier reuse  not everyone uses category of recent destinations 4. - of course trial mode for users to try is the must on android market  to pay such amount of money. thanks god i did buy navigon - its ui an functionaly are really poor.,PERFORMANCE
1613,co pilot europe fantastic bit of software  so impressed i bought it for the wife's s3 as well. currently running this on my galaxy s  wifi 5.0 & s2. not memory intensive as others have suggested unless there device's are steam powered! does more than tom tom with loads of free extras and free lifetime updates. it's a no brainer .. buy it!,OTHER

1637,lacking needs user customizable battery saving options.,OTHER
1638,battery saver with some quirks i downloaded this mainly for the battery saving features. some of the ways it handles power management seem a bit odd  however.  one of the main things that bugs me the most is that it seems to be disabling bluetooth when connected to a power source (such as my car charger)  forcing me to manually re-enable bluetooth. (i did not have this issue prior to downloading the app.) why turn off a power-using feature like bluetooth if it is connected to a charger  particularly since many states have laws requiring bluetooth or other hands-free phone use while driving?  would have given it 4 stars  but had to knock off 1 due to this glitch.,BUG

1708,great alarm  but has new bug making it use lots of battery i like this alarm  i definitely like being able to wake up to a random playlist. but since an update its now using massive amounts of battery using the gps. i'm guessing it's something to do with sunrise feature. i don't use the sunrise alarm and i certainly don't move between countries enough for it to constantly be updating. so either a setting to not allow access to gps or to only update once a day would be useful. otherwise i'll have to go back to the standard alarm until it's fixed.,ENERGY

1717,great game  but unfortunate update i previously had a perfect 5-star review for this game. the new update definitely made a few things nicer. my favorite change was that you can now easily make very long lines without having to stop to scroll. however  the lack of non-facebook syncing is what changed this to a 4-star review. still an amazing game  but i'd like to see that feature re-added... and i just read that they got rid of the random puzzles. why in the world would you get rid of that?,FEATURE

1752,good but high battery usage i like this app but a few weeks ago it started using 13% of my battery.  sent emails and feedback but got no help so far. 13% is too much as i only make changes once per day so other than syncing that change what else does it do to use all that battery? beware. still eating battery. this is after the recent 'battery life improvement' claim by the developer.,ENERGY

1765,promising start but no signs of progress had a promising start but no signs of any updates. as it is  it's a very basic note taking app  which isn't necessarily a bad thing - not everyone needs fully featured apps like evernote. but i'm really surprised at the lack of functionality considering the development power google has at its disposal.,OTHER
1766,good app works very well.  seems to use more battery than it should need (6% in a day even when i haven't used it).,ENERGY
1767,meh. you get 1 picture per note. it tends to be a little bit blurry compared to the original. recipts too blurry to read. the text space is limited. i found this out the hard way when i pasted part of my 2013 diary into it  cleared the old item  and found i had lost serveral weeks of my diary. grrr. there are better apps out there. i'll give an extra star because it syncs flawlessly and looks pretty. uninstall.,USABILITY
1768,perfect on the run.. google keep works awesome when i'm really busy and don't have time to find a pen and pad. i'm a roofer and i use keep most often up on the roof when plans or random thoughts come to memory.,OTHER
1769,draining battery does what it's supposed to do  but it is draining my battery too much when i leave it synced. please stop it from waking my phone from deep sleep so much so that i can leave it synced.,ENERGY
1770,works well latest update brought some much needed visual updates. sync seems to consume more battery then i'd like so i disable that.,ENERGY
1771,love this app! this app has helped me tremendously! i suffered a brain injury in 2009 & tried several different apps that would b a gr8 tool in assisting me w/ my short term memory issues. this is best app 4 that! hands down! i love this helpful app!,OTHER
1772,brilliant app  but no notification noise! i love this app on my nexus 5  but since the last update there are now no notification noises. it either makes a partial noise  sometimes just vibrates or the majority of the time  doesn't make any noise whatsoever! this isn't helpful when i need reminding of various things  because i'll only see the notification in the notification bar after i'm supposed to have remembered it! i have found forums online where other people have the same problem. i hope there will be an update to fix this bug soon.,BUG
1773,good but high battery usage i like this app but a few weeks ago it started using 13% of my battery.  sent emails and feedback but got no help so far. 13% is too much as i only make changes once per day so other than syncing that change what else does it do to use all that battery? beware.,ENERGY
1774,sri krishna same here! bug in the latest update! updated and while launching widget that shows loading but not loading kindly fix widget that shows loading... instead of listing. without widget it has almost lost its functionality.,BUG
1775,good but high battery usage i like this app but a few weeks ago it started using 13% of my battery.  sent emails and feedback but got no help so far. 13% is too much as i only make changes once per day so other than syncing that change what else does it do to use all that battery? beware. still eating battery. this is after the recent 'battery life improvement' claim by the developer. update - in the last 2 hours after charging my screen consumed 13% and keep used 19%. so have downgraded tp one star until  this gets fixed,ENERGY
1776,embryonic - shows promise. too many devices excluded. this will evolve fast. evernote  it's not  but there is a space for a separate  similar app that can leverage the google ecosystem. am using alongside evernote  and will watch with interest .   current big pro: use multiple google accounts to run separate keep accounts alongside one another. eg one personal  one for family.  current big con: limited to certain devices. runs on galaxy notes (n7000  n7100  n8000) but not s5300.   evernote runs on all of these.,OTHER
1777,draining when sync is on  it's really draining the battery on s3 and on note 3.,ENERGY
1778,great and pretty  but heavy on battery in my experience it uses about 3% of battery even when i don't use it or make any changes on other devices. what does it do then so much?,ENERGY
1779,i expect better from google the big g finally understands that design matters  but this is merely a weak app wearing pretty lipstick. aside from quick shopping lists  i don't really see the point as-is. also  the geofencing never works on time for me. as many have already stated  i'm sticking with evernote for now.,OTHER
1780,bug latest update has some battery issues,ENERGY
1781,hot game fun game seemed harder when i was a kid though i remember dishing coins in this game and  dieing nstantly....now i beat it in a lil under 20 min never knew this game was that short for the price they should throw in dragons lair 2 or space ace for free,OTHER
1782,retro remember playing this back then in arcades! works good on mytouch 4g. now i really want dragons lair 2 and space ace!,OTHER

1786,awesome!! a perfect version of what i remember in the arcade from the early eighties.i hope to see space ace in the near future. thunderbolt.,OTHER
1787,wow...totally worth $5! loved this game as a kid  however it was impossibly difficult at the arcade. the control prompts make this easier for a novice  the scenes load fast  great graphics  unlimited lives  and can continue from your saved game....what more could you ask for?! hope the developer releases space ace too!!,OTHER
1788,dragon's lair ii as well  please! i love all the don bluth games! bummed how this is the only one that ever seems to get released on most platforms when it's the one with the most primitive animation and voice.  i'd love to buy high-res (or any res  really) versions of dragon's lair  dragon's lair ii  and space ace.,FEATURE

1790,this takes me back i was obsessed with this game back in the mid 80's! back then it never occured to me that i would one day be able to play it whenever i wanted too!  some of the timings are off though so... only 4 stars for that.  please bring out space ace!,BUG
1791,wow! this is friggin' awesome - i remember this game was in a great 80's arcade  back in the day and in my former home town. what memories! many quarters blown on this one...can't wait for space ace!,OTHER
1792,just like 83! so many people saying the controls are slow or that it's too easy... ok  just turn off the movement guide in the options if it's too easy.  :-)  oh  and the controls aren't slow  it's all timing!  to get past the black knight  be ready to hit your last movement faster than the previous ones.   dev  please give us space ace and time warp!  mad dog mccree would be great too!  the android numbers continue to climb faster and faster  please don't just focus on ios!,OTHER

1796,good but this app rapes my battery. fun otherwise,ENERGY
1797,cool! i'm really enjoying the game so far  however the game uses up a lot of my internal memory. an option to move to sd would make the game five stars. (my phone doesn't have much internal memory),FEATURE
1798,bad bad  very bad  for a game so simple it has so many cons. cons 1. takes up quite some space 20+mb for a game like this is quite big 2. it freezez everytime i want to play it 3. dosent finish loading  always freezes at 36% pros 1. very good at scamming people,BUG
1799,good but freezes good,BUG
1800,can play again for a while i had trouble getting into the various games  some i couldn't at all but now with patience i can.  sometimes i have to tap a few times but as i understand its not the game it's my phone.  love the game.  i'm pretty addicted lol.,OTHER
1801,delete.  no stars do not deserve space this will be last review  this game is no longer worth the space it uses on my and my family/friends devices. we are all deleting this pathetic game and we all will be posting on our face books how everyone should stay away from this game because all you do is lie cheat and rob everyone. how is it possible to sleep well at night knowing you do this to people. you are nothing but a gridy theif who plays on people who are just trying to enjoy them selves after a long hard day!!!!!!!! deleted,OTHER
1802,its ok. the pay outs are not that great. i don't understand why you have jack pots  as much i have played i have never hit not even one. but it helps to kill time.,OTHER
1803,can't play and i've $150k+ :-( i can't even play anymore!  after un/re-installing and restarting my phone  there is an error with facebook validation.  please fix for 5 stars  i love the games  i play daily!,BUG

1805,eats you're battery life  not worth it. drains battery,ENERGY
1806,excellent app. this app deserves great appreciation  as it has a lot of useful features on the home screen itself. also its simple too. the option to add timings of different countries  weekly weather info  bluetooth on/off  data on/off  wi fi on/off etc are so simple to use and added on the home screen. if the battery consumption can be reduced little more can be an added advantage. also  please try to add more customizations. overall  this app is great and needs to be specially mentioned.,ENERGY
1807,saved ram memory good job,OTHER
1808,excellent!! everything is awesome but so far i have found that whenever i turn on wifi my battery drains after using this software... may it happens due to widgets or panel. but if i turn off it doesn't happen.,ENERGY
1809,? convenient but very unfriendly to the battery,ENERGY
1810,best launcher ever! pretty awsome launcher.one problem it takes too much of my battery life away.hope you can make download much smaller.,ENERGY
1811,awesome it is really good   and see it futures   it is unbelievable . it outlook is so creative . that why i like it . i think  it has one major problem it size is so big for small memory usear .,PERFORMANCE
1812,great but.... great  but decrease alot of battery life on my ace 2,ENERGY
1813,good app great launcher.  i really like it but it is killing my battery.,ENERGY
1814,best vkontakte client by far the best in functionality and gui design (simple and neat). though i wonder why the pro version has admob ads in it  i could understand the free version but why the pro version? still 5 stars but if admob isn't removed from the pro version could cost you a  star for every future update version that this is still in it,USABILITY
1815,down grade. ok app  good range of comics both current and back caterlog. but still a bit of a f around with bugs stuffing it up.   you will bye something and download and have the app force close  stop or frieze without reasion and have to restart   makes this app very data heavy.   additional there are no warnings when a comic has stopped downloading meaning you have to constantly check to see its working.  that and the fact that recites only have a serial number on the not tittle make it had to keep track periches.,BUG
1816,? i can't understand,OTHER
1817,great for comics really like this app and the store selection. wish it had the option to store content on sd card though  large digital collections easily consume all the internal space on my 16gb note 8 tablet with the sd card just sits there empty.,FEATURE
1818,hacked just got notice that their system was hacked and all our info is out there! good job can't even protect our info!,SECURITY
1819,love it! i love the app  very happy to be able to read the comics on my phone. i love the cell transitions which is perfect when i share my comics with my kids and the page layout is a complex design and they have a hard time following.  only problem i have is that i would like to be able to save the comic book files to my external memory. only because it's eating up my phone storage and preventing app installations.,FEATURE
1820,meh its okay can be fun to use sometimes but most of the options are lame or don't fit right but the black and white comic strip options are its best features and fun to use.,OTHER
1821,freezes all the time 4shared is better then this one cause it does not freeze and crash all the time...,BUG
1822,not too thrilled all this app really does is compile your phones videos into one place. very much like default phone video player. i dont find this app necessary because it takes up space on phone. may be useful with older model phones  just not my style.,OTHER
1823,worked good at first... when i first got it  it worked well  now it freezes up and only displays blank white screen.,BUG
1824,great app with some tweaks needed would love to have push updates in the background despite the battery drain and when refreshing   preventing me from clicking into a delivery is not what i would expect it to do. otherwise a really well put together piece of software,ENERGY
1825,simple and effective easy to use and understand  just drop in the tracking number and select the courier.   clean ui  no complicated menus to decipher.  easily the best tracking app i have used.,OTHER
1826,last update good job but error after last update please fix it soon,BUG
1827,great apps works well and looks great. lots of available providers. from the 5 or so apps i've tested  deliveries seems to support the most.  i submitted a bug report when statuses from one of the providers wasn't working as expected. the developer promptly got back to me and fixed the issue.   only feature i would like is auto-detection of provider based on the tracking number. but as a fellow programmer i understand the challenges presented by such a feature  so this doesn't affect my rating.,FEATURE
1828,love on phone  hate on tab 3 tablet works perfect on my phone but when i installed it on my tab 3 it freezes very often and takes a long time to load. please fix!,BUG
1829,great app great app but please some of us with limited memory need to save ebooks to sd card,FEATURE
1830,good but... looking at the space that apps use  i noticed aldiko using quite a lot. so i went to the android folder which has all the app data files  i then checked the .download and .import folder under com.aldiko. every single book downloaded and imported were there named as random numbers and in some proprietary format.....i had to delete over 300 files in the .import....seriously can you ensure that this data is cleaned up after an import. it's unnecessary.,PERFORMANCE
1831,bugs i loved this but this morning when i tried to open it the screen just went black and when i exit the page shows for a second but when i re-open it the black screen appears again. i checked for updates but there wasn't any. please fix this. thank you.,BUG
1832,? its fun  decent library  but eats battery!,ENERGY

1834,slow as hell... freezes after a few page flips for a while... very sluggish compared to other readers,PERFORMANCE
1835,only 4 stars i love this app. i am able to save all of my pdf and epub documents. i only have it 4 stars because when in night mode is it very sensitive and if touched wrong the entire screen will turn the lettering black and i have to re-install the app. please work on brightness feature.,FEATURE
1836,excellent indeed i just have a small problem  the lights always boosts to max when reading hence consuming my battery faster. but other than that  an excellent app :),ENERGY
1837,library on ext. memory it'll be better if this app support external memory as its target for library files.  and also a flipping animation should be great too.,FEATURE
1838,good but sucks battery power. i love everything about this app except that it does not allow you to control brightness. it seems to override whatever brightness setting i have on my phone and it goes to maximum brightness. this causes in a big drop in battery life. beyond that i really do like this app  but if you want to read for a long time on trips or anything like that you really need to find one that uses less power.,ENERGY
1839,excellent !!! samsung captivate (galaxy s).  using this app has substantially improved the battery longevity  as the display is the primary power spender.  a must have.,OTHER

1841,exellent have used this on 3 android phones. i use it everyday. so simple and easy to use. download now as you will save your eyes and battery,OTHER
1842,doesn't work when battery is low i downloaded this because i simply cannot live with the auto dimmer when the battery gets low. but this app doesn't work at all if the battery is low (which is the only time you need it!)  so it's useless.,ENERGY

1865,wow beta it is  the app crashes on starting up 1 in 3 times and some times i need to fiddle with cables to get it to go.  however  this app is amazing and we'll worth the money. the options and control that you have is great. i wish that you could set options without a camera just to play with the app and get a feel for the menus without running down battery's.   canon 50d and moto photon running cm9,ENERGY
1866,works great! using this with an xperia z and a canon 400d  everything behaves as expected. wish i'd shopped around and got an otg cable that would charge too  but battery life (on the phone) hasn't been a problem yet.,OTHER
1867,live view looking real good so far. i'm mostly gonna use it as external monitor for video shooting. so is there any chance to have a real full screen live view for 1.0  without the default android buttons at the bottom? even a small space like this makes a huge difference on ours tiny screens! thanks,USABILITY
1868,almost perfect! but still amazing!!!!! this one app was the reason i got an android tablet over the ipad. a regular field monitor costs about the same if not much much more than a tablet. and that's for a standard 7 inch screen that's often times sub hd  with the nexus 10 (what i'm using) you have a 10 inch 2k screen with longer battery life and full camera control. it's almost crazy more people don't use this!!!  here's the one catch  the lag. it does lag a bit which makes run and gun shooting tough to say the least. i don't really do that kind of shooting as i usually will set up shots for scripted and partially scripted shoots. so for me it's really great.  if you absolutely need a filed monitor for run and gun/ fast moving subjects  it will be a better option. if you use one occasionally during interviews or other non fast moving situations  this is an incredibly amazing option. if they figure out the lag issue before the first official release then there is no reason not to get this instead of a dedicated monitor for the control features  screen size  price  screen resolution.  this developer is brilliant!!!!,OTHER
1869,zenophil had this app for a while now on samsung galaxy s3 - using both canon 7d and canon 5d mk3 both work like a charm. after seeing chainfire's tutorial and the use of tplink mr3040 i decide to purchase nexus7 ii and the mr-3040 - all in all in took about 5 minutes to set it up (included flashing the wireless battery operate router with downloadable special firmware) and voila! now able to control my camera wirelessly. great job thanks so much.,OTHER
1870,the best app when i came across this app i was a little leery about buying a beta  but to my surprise it works like a charm. i'm into doing wild life and thus needed the means to get remote control shots. dslr with the little tp link battery operated modem makes it so easy to get the shots i want. i was very impressed with the amount of control using the wi-fi with the tp-link modem. hands down this is the best app i've ever tried for doing remote shooting and if you like video it works there as well. i can't wait till the full version 1.0 becomes available.,OTHER
1871,nexus 10 / 5d mk3 issues big and small i've been looking to use this app mostly to review images on the fly during portrait and fashion shoots.  biggest issue: not saving jpgs to the tablet (raw+jpg mode). reviewing a shoot has to be done from camera; android gallery app can do this and it's free.  second biggest: freezes for about 10 seconds between the main screen and review screen (maybe cable length is a factor?).  niggles: follow shot is my most used feature but takes too many clicks to set up. has to be configured to full screen on every use.  can't review previous images in follow shot screen. painfully slow when switching screens. in full screen the app still doesn't use entire screen  leaving navigation bar. image review screen doesn't use whole screen even in full screen mode  still shows image info.  i am one of many people who just need an image review (follow shot) app without live view functionality. maybe you would consider spinning that off as separate app? hard to believe that such a frequently used feature of tethered shooting  a staple of eos utility  so hard to find for android - dslr controller by far the best attempt so far.  i'll test a bit more but not sure if it's a keeper in it's present state.,BUG
1872,s3 and canon 1100d although experienced a couple of freezes and an odd image preview glitch its ok. needs development to make it worth the ?5. commands all work with camera.,BUG

1879,good app. small niggles works smooth. worth while app even on small entry level samsung gt models  gingerbread device. list is good. search good. but selecting from search a tad frustrating. on tapping the list resets search. record quality good. space consumption is economical. however upon some use  found switching calls does not register seperate recording but it then stll records  so one has a copy  for editing.   i like. thanks guys/girls.,OTHER
1880,the best its been 2 years since i have reviewed this theme and wanted to re review it. this is still one of my favorite themes of all time. so much so that i painstakingly add wallpaper and each icon to my homescreen when not using go(nothing wrong with go i just need other features) if you look around there is also an all black and green go sms theme as well. even with all the crazy colorful themes z.t.arts makes i still get mad compliments on this one. its very android  i just love it!!thanx z.t.arts!!,OTHER

2507,useless on andriod had the free version of this on my iphone  and it has 100x the features that it has for .99c on the andriod. paid for it  noticed the lack of features and quailty. hit refund. all within 60 seconds. shame that it sucks so bad.,OTHER
2508,average at best the gesture features are really great. i do like the one when my phone is in my pocket. however  it does lack some main features. f.e. albums are split every time it has songs with featuring artists. why is there even an album artist section on a music file if you dont consider it...? and i miss sort all tracks by album artist (and not artist only!)  but this is the case with almost any android player. to sum up  yet another poor android player that chooses to have something fancy instead of the essentials,USABILITY
2509,love it (: i love this app! (: i think  just to make this app more awesome  you should add a feature to the heads so either they cling to the side of the screen or they're more free range. (: for example  the facebook heads strictly cling to the side and this app is free range.. i think there should be a setting to choose between the two. :) still love the app  though!! :)  also  it keeps shutting down >.< i open a conversation by clicking the head and they all crash :(,FEATURE

2512,4 stars .. interesting app. but lack some photo editing features,FEATURE
2513,make a good app 343. i can't even open the app because of the prompts for the settings profiles. obviously something that is much above my knowledge base. feels like i have a developer version.   i know halo reach isn't your game   but make a effort. i have a feeling bungie would have had this down perfectly.   well   i'll give you some slack for trying to take on bungies intense stat tracking features. (try and match it in the next halo game  please),USABILITY
2514,great game but it could be the best.. you should add a chat feature during guild wars that allows you to talk to rival guilds and/or make it possible to trade armor or armor ingredients with buddies,FEATURE
2515,wow !!!! great game! !! this is a really incredibly well done game.  it does very well and is very addictive.  the artistry is wonderful.  i love the detail in the entire game.  don't miss the bonus feature  with the additional games.  the ending ties together  the story very nicely. i have played out several times now and have enjoyed it just like the first time.,OTHER
2516,texts if your in the process of typing and receive a text it deletes what you already had typed unless you dismiss your incoming text. so i disabled the sms feature. other than that i like it.,BUG
2517,simple  trouble free app does what it's supposed to - which is to set up the chromecast stick on your network.   not sure why all these people are complaining about features  or lack of  of the chromecast device itself - they have nothing to do with this app...,OTHER
2518,love this app... but i've been using poweramp for 3-4 years  and i've been impressed with the extensive functionality and features. the music always sound clear  with unbelievable bass feedback. but  i'm not satisfied with this recent update. my music sounds terrible. the rich bass is gone  and replaced with a hollow  hard thump on beat drops. i can say that i'm knowledgeable of every feature on this app.  i've configured the equalizer  tone  and soundfx feature as much as possible to get the sound that i've lost. i've also turned off the tablet's built-in sound enhancer. no luck... i'm forced to use my stock music player  which sounds like how my poweramp used to sound. please developer  revert this update.  i miss using this app.,OTHER
2519,awesome full featured music player with one exception. intuitive design and smooth music player.  it's chock full of features including autostop and autoplay when disconnecting auxilery audio cable or bluetooth headset and replay gain to normalize some of my low volume music.  the only thing that's missing to make this a one stop music player is the lack of playlist total playtime!  that would be very handy to create a playlist for an event where knowing if i have enough music to last the entire time.,FEATURE
2520,simply the best i very rarely write reviews. even more rare is when i like an app enough to buy it. this app deserves both. i have  seriously  tried most music players for the android and this one has everything i need. audio engine is tops  start and stop via headphone jack  great album art download. lots of other programs have these things but either lack in these or other features. i especially like the simple issue of bass and treble control. price a little high  that was the only thing holding me back from buying it sooner. was thinking of giving it 4 stars because of price but; what the heck- i gave it five.,OTHER
2521,love this app should add the feature:  sendto todo list from other apps to this one.   also the ability to choose the path of backups such as external_sd,FEATURE

2523,makes me miss my iphone i want an app to help me navigate the park. while it does have wait times  although i dont know how reliable  its missing important  things like a park map and complete menus. not everyone knows every inch of the park like the back of their hand.   this app also has a ton of useless features. full access to the forums for one.  who goes to the park to spend time on a forum? live webcams. i'm already there!!  i can't beleive this is the only option we have other than touringplans. disappointing.,USABILITY
2524,misses some features i miss the group participation features. it would mile too to have some1to1 chat on mobile. it works fine on my galaxy note 2,FEATURE
2525,solid and intimate its a solid web browser and the customizing features make for an intimate and streamlined web browsing experience. flash doesn't play nicely though  you should add a toggle option for the keyboard on sites with flash heavy forms,USABILITY
2526,fast better than chrome  but does lack other top browser features  still 5 stars.  it does what it's supposed to,FEATURE
2527,best browsrer for android i have used many browsers including opera  chrome and firefox but they are not as good as their desktop vesrion. they lack of many features. i knew about dolphin browser before but i thought it wasn't good. today i decided to give it a try and i loved it!! it's very smooth  lightweight  fast  has many feautures and very easy to use. thanks for this app!,OTHER
2528,best browser... ... to date  runs brilliantly and browses the quickest on my galaxy s3  it's just way above  the rest of the browsers i've tested(including my favourites on pc - firefox & opera). couldn't care less about the swipe features  but a very good gui nonetheless - 10/10 would bang. the only thing i miss are  well  firefox plugins.,FEATURE
2529,it's got it all new to this android environment and must've tested every browser out there.  dolphin has every feature you can ask for while all other browsers lack one feature or another. think i finally found a home browser that can match any desktop any day.,OTHER
2530,always come back to it pretty good. i have been using easy profiles for over a year - have tried others  but always come back to it. i only miss being able to set some settings without selecting a profile (e.g. enabling or disabling display timeout depending on the foreground app). i miss the screenlock feature  too. used to be there...,FEATURE
2531,hideous logo  weird permissions  lack of features dropbox has now lost me as a paying customer. the new logo is horrible  the app has a lack of features  and the new permissions we are forced to accept are just weird. i don't want the app to access my camera or contacts!,SECURITY
2532,best cloud so far i used to be a sugarsync user  but after they changed there free policy  i swap to dropbox to find out a much better cloud package...i do not give it 5 stars becaue of he lack of some features that are replaced by third party apps. (these features needed for me is the freedom to sync any folder on my pc and android device... so you requiere symbolic links in windows and dropsync ($) on android).,FEATURE
2533,mediocre this is an ok app it would be alot better if they stoped gatekeeping site features for paying members only. the ui can be very hit and miss and defys the laws of ergonomics at times requireing frequent reloading of the app when the ui fails. the sight  also suffers from a lack of diversity in its user base compared to other dating apps.,USABILITY
2534,miss moody excellent app! simple and easy to grasp. lots of features and pretty too :-),OTHER
2535,suggestion you should add a test draw feature for the decks in the next update.,FEATURE

2537,need less confusing options also needs an option to lock when pressing power button vs. screen timeout delay. i had this in my last rom and miss this feature.,FEATURE
2538,? very good interface  except for the lack of an easily accessible undo feature.,USABILITY
2539,need some features..!! i miss the landscape optn...actually that really helps when u hav a bigger phone...and dis makes difficult in portrait modes...hope i'll see this feature very soon!,FEATURE
2540,very helpful! i imagine this will be a very useful app as it gets closer and closer to black friday! seems pretty easy to go through all the stores to see where to find the best deal! i really like the shopping list feature so i can save the deals that i'm most interested in!,OTHER
2541,one thing missing i really like this app. simple user interface and works smoothly. espn should add a feature to notify you when your current selection is finished. that is the only thing missing.,FEATURE
2542,pretty decent works like its supposed to  great for editing pics. love to see a lot more features for editing  there are many stickers and clip art categories you are missing as well. seems like you don't plan on adding new stuff cause ive had this app a while now and it's been minor changes the whole time. please consider adding a diff color background option with black a black edged pic means you can't see the edges.,FEATURE
2543,great improvements the features on the new mobile app are exceptional. in addition  is a much faster app than the old version. i love the averaging of totals as opposed to the raw totals  which were difficult to analyze because of the lack of information concerning the number of games played over the selected span.  in fact  the biggest improvement that can be made is one more column that lists the number of games played over the particular selected time span.,FEATURE
2544,gets the job done i was a handyshopper user and  although i miss being able to record aisles and prices for many stores for one item  i love that i can add something to the shopping list with my phone and my husband can see it immediately on his phone.  i also like that out of milk has a web site where i can build a list  so when i'm planning meals for the week  i can be building the list too using a regular keyboard.  i see the value of the pantry option.  i'll probably be using it to keep an inventory of our freeer and our spices.  i would like to see a way to add items to more than one list.  for example  i'd like chips to be on the costco list and the snack list so if i'm shopping at one store and see a great price  i'd know i needed chips.  overall  thisi app gets the job done and it's popularity makes me think the features i want may be added some day.,FEATURE
2545,does what it says -1 for speed -1 for graphics -1 for features -1 for price  way too overpriced for a low quality app like this one. this is the only feature i miss from my iphone  android is a much better os and they still haven't come up with a similar/decent app to control itunes? -_-,OTHER
2546,fantastic and more features on the way!  i loved apex  mainly because of its app drawers  and i still miss that  that's the only feature i really miss custom and organised app drawers. and if you released a paid version with only that. i'd gladly drop $5. heck i'd pay that already.,FEATURE
2547,great launcher what a nice launcher  should add locker feature,FEATURE
2548,swell spectacular scintillating man i don't what to say.far better than go silk smart and atom.but still needs a major and complete make over.everybody know s about its advantage s.still some thing s that are missing.take my word seriously you may think i'm crazy but it will help to double your populariy and combination.1.sidebar missing 2.few wallpapers 3.no upper and bottom dock 4.speed is not up to the mark 5.absence of gesture drawing feature according to drawing specific apps open 5.lack of icon pack and more long review already,FEATURE
2549,great app  service not going the direction i'd like the app fulfills its purpose  is relatively quick  has a usable ui  and i've never had it crash.  not really sure about fitocracy as a platform any more  -maybe what they want to be and what i want them to be are two different things.  the mechanics don't seem to be getting the kind of upgrades i'd have hoped for. whilst they have a variety of exercises to choose from  they don't have everything and they seem to be rarely updated. far too many of my exercises have to go under generic/incorrect items such as bicep curls. this makes it really difficult to use the stats to track my progress. i wish they would either open up this section to trusted users to add to the repository or allow users to create new activities. also i'm disappointed in the lack of a public api - i'm sure there's tons of people with great ideas for what could be done with all the data - especially seems as fitocracy themselves aren't doing much with it. the social features are good but as a stat junkie i feel my data is less precise than it could be  and woefully inaccessible... but i can't quit levelling up. clearly in hooked - it really is like an rpg!,FEATURE
2550,manual focus i have used this app for years and it has always been the best one on the store. however it has fallen from grace due to the lack of touch focus on the recent update which makes it hard to scan small tags up close. it would be great to see the return of that feature and maybe manual focus?,FEATURE
2551,pretty good the app is pretty good  but the new sms feature is not acceptable.  i was very excited when i saw the update  but now i am disappointed. it works in its very essence  but even then it's very clumsy. things like only allowing the text being sent to one person  not allowing the ringing the editing of the recipient after initial insertion  etc. the text messages take forever to actually be sent. plus  it's an eyesore compared to the rest of the app. the cursor and send button are white on a white background and so are difficult to see...at least make it black to match. it's clear to me that they threw it in last second without much testing.,USABILITY
2552,good game to kill time. i think you all should add more features. for example  a room  for friends to play together. i believe it would be better(:,FEATURE
2553,love this alarm! this app has more features than i could ever use. options are endless. my favorite part is being able to set the flash and vibrate to happen before the sound. my only complaint is sometimes the snooze/dismiss screen does not come upwhen it should  so i end up snoozing with the power button just to shut it up. originally bought for lg optimus  also used on my touch  and now lg g2.,BUG
2554,i love it i love the app for all of it's features. i still occasionally have this bug... when i dismiss the alarm the alarm sound stops momentarily then restarts immediately and i have found no way to stop the sound again with out restarting the phone... i have a galaxy s3. i use the math dismiss feature.,BUG
2555,? used this for quite a while  learned to work around the ui bugs. i work and sleep on a complicated schedule so some of the features were great. not anymore... it has become unreliable  you will miss work. sometimes you must reboot to end an alarm too..,BUG
2556,great  despite some bugs it has all functionality you need. you ll never miss an alarm again. i would ask for some extra features such as : nap alarms should be editable as nap  not just as absolute and. a system option could control if dismissed nap alarms are deleted automatically. note that nap alarms are usually not regular alarms and  so not due to reuse.   steger creating some alarms out does not update home screen. developer  attention to tix minor bug.,FEATURE

2558,okay for the most part  it's a great alarm clock. the only issue i'm having is that it's still ringing after i dismiss it. there's nothing in the settings about it or anything  it's not a feature (that i'm aware of). the only way i've been able to shut it off is by force closing it.,BUG
2559,i love it! it is a fun game especially for children. you should add more features to it but it is still 5 stars. great job.,FEATURE
2560,crash and lack of features first of all it crashed on my galaxy s4. also you can't rewind or fast forward tracks. also you don't have access to profiles of people that you're following.,BUG
2561,this is great it looks good and it works well.  i do jeweler want a roper dismiss feature so it shuts up about that specific event.  also  a function to make it show in the notification pull down menu would be great! at least one tablets.,FEATURE
2562,heads up feature something's wrong with the heads up feature on htc one. the notifications keep coming back even after you dismiss it,BUG
2563,buggy new heads up feature is incredibly buggy. poor qc. can't dismiss heads up reminders. if it isn't remedied in the next day or so  i'll uninstall. it's annoying and counterproductive.,BUG
2564,excellent i uninstalled it several time duebto yhe widget featurevlack now that we have one am quite happy.. great app 5stars!!,OTHER
2565,finally! i was extremely hesitant to purchase this app since it was lagging behind in iphone features.  now that it's on par with the iphone features  it's worth every penny.  i did miss out on the $20.00 deal in late fall oh well...i'm still happy with the app.    note to developers:  android users would purchase this app if the release cycles are close to the iphone's app.  don't neglect the android community.,OTHER
2566,great news tool i miss two features  though: tapping images to open them  and a dark theme.,FEATURE
2567,useless such a lack of detail and features  it is a waste of space.,OTHER
2568,great game! you should add more buildings and a 'upgrade' feature near start of game  also add more land ?,FEATURE
2569,love groupon  but app needs work you miss out on alot of features vs the desktop version. ie  can not make one final purchase  but multiple purchases for each individual item.  cant take advantage of free shipping when buying more.   also  a feature to filter the products into categories (vs just goods or local) would be nice.,FEATURE
2570,good app great app! miss the text message feature though.,FEATURE
2571,better than avg not as fully featured as the full site. miss seeing editor's choices and features. a must for deal hunters.,FEATURE
2572,cool :) its pro  should add more features,FEATURE
2573,how do i donate?! shut up and take my money! i've used many cache and system cleaners before this and have always been  turned off by the ui and lack of user-friendliness.  360 blew me away when i used its cleaning features.  i will never not use this app  cleared out over 4 gb of data in one sweep!,OTHER
2574,update: great ui and powerful detection but... as stated above this antivirus app has a very nice and intuitive ui and the protection is top quality (rated highest in av-labs) but a few simple features let it down  the app only scans installed apps and not sd files ect. missing features would be a 'scheduled scan' set on certain days/times by user  'automatic update' before 'scheduled scan'  new main theme like pc version & black notifer panel/widget themes. other than that  its an epic app and i will continue to use it thank you :),FEATURE
2575,absolutely wonderful! has all the features of premium antivirus absolutely free....  cool ui high privacy boosts spped.  excellent app... a mostwanted app for android devices. ..  the one and only drawback is lack of themes... i got bored of the white theme... could use more creative themes..need a more good looking tray in the notification panel...    keep yp the gud work (y) ..!,OTHER
2576,really like this app allows me to both catalog my collection and display and sort my collection to make it easier for friends to decide what they want to watch.  i recommend you get the pro version. it's diverse features and ability to access your database from any of your appliances or computers is a blessing. the ability to modify the meta data stored for your movies would be good as sometimes the data is miss classified or incorrectly genred,OTHER
2577,the simplicty has gine the latest update is a step back  i know you can't please everyone but the reason i chose the older version was it's simplicity and lack of unnecessary bloat. so much so that i even put up with it crash every time i ran it and had to run it twice to get working. i also miss the ability to look back  another feature which most apps don't have. why remove that?,FEATURE
2578,good but lacking all in all the app works  but its pretty lack-luster. it does a few things well and a few ok  like the feed  friends list and adding  messaging  and connecting to your ps4 for second display features. but it stops there. the store takes you a external browser  the second screen features are limited and the keyboard is a bit buggy and only works 70% of the time  its slow and the positioning of things is not efficient. the ui isn't all that intuitive with its lack of gestures and easily accessible features.,FEATURE
2579,far from as cool as smartglass i went with a ps4 rather than the xbox one  but i do miss smart glass. they need to make this app enable the voice features  and things like the store should be built-in  not a browser link.,FEATURE
2580,should add more filters filters are a little lame and don't suit my pictures. if you add more filters  i'll rate it 5 stars &lt;3 and you should add more fonts  and unique features unlike other editing apps.,FEATURE
2581,i love it i love this app and use it when posting pics on ig. the only thing i miss is how i use to be able to flip the same photo and have it facing the other. it was so cool and made pics more interesting. pls bring this back so i don't have to install another app just for that feature.,FEATURE
2582,nice apps  lack of stability and features it would be better if there is downloading and downloaded list rather than checking each kind of genre. the player features is also lack most of important features. very prone to crash if it's running in the background.,FEATURE
2583,what if you added a  feature to estimate your calories. when i miss a day (always horrible) the app assumes i ate nothing that day and my weekly nutrition does not include that day. the ability to assume an average of calories based on previous days would be incredibly helpful.,FEATURE
2584,awesome app .. love every thing about it!! must admit i started out looking for a food diary but this is amazing!  the my recipes feature is my favorite.   i don't have to miss out .. just enter the recipe and the rest easy.,OTHER
2585,very useful app. (nexus 7 2nd gen)                                                                                                                          this app is really good  looks great and seems to be accurate. some stuff is still messed up for me though  one thing being the create recipe feature (that i still miss alot)  and the barcode scanner screws up  also the top of my app goes black every so often :(.,FEATURE
2586,lack features no decimal point on weight goal. no calc beginning vs desired weight. no browseable recipes or activities beyond exercise. got pie chart and fb  so what? fatsecret can do a lot more than this.,FEATURE
2587,nice app they should add a priority feature in it...so that the task with highest priority can be on top of the stack!!,FEATURE
2588,what i wanted i'm not big on changing a lot of stuff on my phone but this i had to get. i love all the things you can customize and especially love that the app menu is transparent instead of a black screen. i wish more features were available for free but i like what i have too,FEATURE
2589,solid launcher! looked around in the settings  and managed to make the drawer look like gel's  which is perfect. much more customizability  compared to gel  and doesn't hog memory either. perfect! worth the money for bonus features.  only drawback is lack of google now  which is - hopefully - yet to be implemented. for this reason  i'll give 4 stars. once it's been implemented  5 star app!,FEATURE
2590,great app for a fair price this app is a well rounded app and is the best of its kind on the market. the only cons include  lag  lack of minor features  and it tends to sometimes crash alot,PERFORMANCE
2591,best audio player excellent sound quality and have all setting features. but one thing i miss is setting star rating to songs.,FEATURE
2592,the new update makes it great it's probably the most beautiful google reader app and it doesn't lack usability and features either. i only wish for 2 changes : the ability to edit my feeds and better performance especially in android 4.3...,FEATURE
2593,conference scores miss the conference scores feature for college basketball in the new version.,FEATURE
2594,from plume to carbon  a whole new universe after being annoyed with plume  an other twitter client for android  because of invasive ads  i decided to give carbon a try... and i don't regret it! everything can be accessed quickly and without digging in infinite submenus.  the only features i miss would be a real time update on new mentions/dm  and led color customization.,FEATURE
2595,? easy to use and simple but miss some features like changing color or font for multiple nodes,FEATURE
2596,awesome features  terrible management this is my favorite video calling app because of all the neat stuff it can do. but the lack of a friends list and the requirement of a phone number are dragging it down hard. i want to be able to use it with my phone  tablet  and pc ask on the same profile. make an effective profile. stop piggy backing my phone's contact list and make an effective profile system and it will be perfect.,FEATURE
2597,unbelievable how they screw customers over i've been waiting for this app to be released since i bought my 1912.  i'm completely blown away that they are screwing the old customers and making an app thats only compatible with the 13 devices.  the 12's obviously have the capability  i'm going to be selling my denon and will never buy another denon product.  between this app and the lack of feature upgrades denon has really disappointed me.,OTHER
2598,post upgrade the app has become more friendly after the upgrade. also a lot of info is being covered. it should add the feature of pushing news to the user via pop-ups like its sister app,FEATURE
2599,lack some features please provide option for marking notifications as read or unread also option for commenting on post using picture,FEATURE
2600,what happened to the news feed sort order??? looks good at first glance with an extensive menu to enable account management and configuration... then i realise the option to order the news feed posts by time/date has been removed. there will be a lot of stuff i'm going to miss until this has been resolved  very disappointed. i'm not the sort to scroll continuously just to find the latest updates from friends. i want it to be there in front of me. either i'm missing something or there has been a huge oversight when rolling out the latest release. this is going to be a 1 star until i can find guidance on where this feature has been moved to or the sort ability has been restored. additional info: i have just had version 8.0.0.26.24 pushed out to me  update: seems to work on some level this morning (a day later) but the ordering is still unpredictable. a bit bugy but better than it was. strangely it's still the same release as if it took a while to take effect. very strange,FEATURE
2601,lack possibilities we see fb app on other platforms specifically ios and than this android app and wonder if this app is still in beta phase for android? as this android app lack features.,FEATURE
2602,needs development newsfeed loading time is increasing day by day. 1 star down features i miss copy text from other's post photo comment option unfollow a post,FEATURE
2603,better but still needs work it's better then the last one although i miss the push feature on the top bar,FEATURE
2604,add more feature photo comment should add in this version  when it is done it desrved 5 star!!,FEATURE
2605,sorry but it's not ready yet to beat whatsapp. don't know why rim's server so unreliable compared to other players' in this field. communication is not instantaneous enough.. lack of many features,PERFORMANCE
2606,still not marched triumphant upon its 'younger' competitors. its really funny that other similar services provide voice call for android 2.3 devices with minor issues but worked just fine.then why does a widely-known-through-out-the-world messaging/interaction service from the great blackberry lack it ?.its a hassle to connect my tablet just to voice called my bbm friends which doesn't shared the same pin regardless its bb id.just a standard messaging provided for the gingerbread users which is somewhat useless despite others provide more features/services.,FEATURE
2607,great looks  not useful so... this app looks awesome on the surface  but i had to uninstall because the lack of features available. going back to myfitnesspal to receive all features and more without having to hand over my credit card.,FEATURE
2608,good for unreliable connections. ui needs work the only android client to implement xep-0198  for reliable messaging over unreliable connections. this requires support from your xmpp server -- e.g prosody with the unofficial mod_smash module -- and your colleagues im clients -- e.g. gajim  and gibberbot itself. many of the most popular xmpp servers and clients still lack this critical feature (looking at you  ejabberd  pidgin  xabber). it would be good if other software projects started to take these stream management extensions more seriously  especially as gtalk  with its proprietary stream management  looks like it's biting the dust. we need clients gibberbot (and gajim etc) to get things moving on this front. there are issues with gibberbot. the ui needs work (e.g. the formatting of the chat window changes randomly when scrolling up and down; the background image can be corrupted when touching the screen; there is no option to select a different notification sound  and notifications don't always work with open chats)  and sometimes it takes time to negotiate a connection. xabber has a better ui (and is gpled  hint hint)  but if you must have reliable and secure xmpp messaging on the move  this is currently your only choice.,PERFORMANCE
2609,? one of the best navigation programs  lacks free map download in pro version and customizable trip computer pagei use many versions of navigation applications. this one is highly customizable  and has more features than most. the only downside is a lack of trip computer page with customizable data fields  and inability to download map tiles for free in the pro version. it does have a great compass page with set data fields. osm cycle map is awesome topographical 10k. aerial maps is mapquest only. has many great features that equil or rival garmin stand alone units.,FEATURE
2610,what happened to map search i miss the feature where you can explore around the country on your own. this new version took that out for no reason  it was a really great feature and why i really liked this app.,FEATURE
2611,solid app  unique interface. i really enjoy the cubic organization. this app works well and is impressively clean. most third party players are cluttered with features that are useful but unnecessary  or get in the way of the music. the only reason this is not a five star app is the lack of alac support. coming from an apple environment  many of my cds were ripped to lossless to preserve quality whilst talking up less space. the addition of alac support would make this the only player i use.,FEATURE
2612,ever best. but.. since update. many feature gone and  many lack when use.,OTHER
2613,this is now my default camera app. the one missing feature i noticed  (versus the aosp camera) is the lack of zoom in video mode.,FEATURE
2614,lots of features this app is incomparable in it's feature list  but it does lack some intuitiveness to the user interface. very useful app once you learn it.,USABILITY
2615,more features please a very good game but it lack a little more features thank you             :-),FEATURE
2616,great but... great app. stable  smooth and has great features  but not as many as moon+. really the only thing that bugs me is lack of vertical scrolling on epubs  especially when trying to annotate something that goes over 2 pages. this feature would make it the best reader on android. also some more theme customisation features would be nice but the vertical scrolling should be at the top of the dev list.,FEATURE
2617,one of the best exchange mail apps it took me a few days to get used to it (i was using samsung's default email client so far). its exchange active sync works fluently and ui has many options and settings as well. one thing i really miss (exists in default s2 email app but for some reason do not exist in any other mail client) is the ability to use bold and color fonts when composing a message. touchdown guys: you did a very good work with this software. adding the this feature will really make it great for me (and special in the market),FEATURE
2618,one of the best but... this is one of the best app's to store sensitive data. i know it supports export to sdcard  but would be awesome (complete application) if allowed sync across devices (like windows for example) and the ability to cloud sync. these lack of features made me choose something else  neverless  this is perfect for a standalone app. congrats to the team for the simplicity and functionality.,FEATURE
2619,update miss download image n photo sync :( update miss download image feature :( n photo sync,FEATURE
2620,cant disable the app? i dont want this app runnin gin the backghround giving me reminders  it needs a feature to disable it from starting up automaticaly  and feature to disable all reminders  the  'pause' thing isnt good enough.  also  white on black text would be better  this is a sleep related app  why the heck is it a bright white screen?,FEATURE
2621,almost perfect ;)(have some suggestions) this game is awesome! i really like that you guys have planes which were in wwi and wwii  especially the b-17. i hope you guys plan to add the b-24 and b-29  also i had an idea for the bombers. because they are different from fighters i think maybe you guys should add turrets that auto fire once a plane gets in range on them so flying a bomber and fighter is completly different. and if you guys could add more customizeable features such as color  i like to have my plne unique  that would be flightastic :),FEATURE
2622,decent app would give this app 5 stars if it had tasker integration  or a better featured alarm system. its a great app for seeing what's going on with your engine  but the alarms lack options or even a simple tasker integration. i emailed the developer over a year  but he seemed less than interested in adding more features to this app.,FEATURE
2623,good nice app but lack certain features,FEATURE
2624,short but fun it's a fun spin on tower defense where you play as an invasion force leading a convoy through a maze of turrets and towers.  there are 3 difficulty levels and 15 main missions.  there are two challenge modes called squad assault where you try to attack through 10 and 20 waves of towers respectively.  each wave gives you 5 minutes to complete.  annoying thing in those modes though is that there is no save feature so if you need to take a break or have an incoming phone call you completely lose your spot.  it's very frustrating.  other than those shortcomings it's a fantastic little strategy game despite lack of replayability.,FEATURE
2625,issue/request...finally--after years of waiting! 1 issue and 1 feature request...   issue is that sort order isn't retained (i.e when i choose sort by thread date instead of last post  and then return to that subforum  it's sorted by last post again).   request is for ability to rep.  thanks!  having been a member since 2004  and lurker before then  i'm so happy to have this on my phone. despite the great site deal alerts  i'd often miss notifications as they got buried among the 50+ emails/day i get.,FEATURE
2626,smaller fonts! i really like the mobile basic html site because i can see way more deals without constantly scrolling down the page.  would also like to see a dark theme for night browsing.  also i miss the ability to subscribe to threads.  edit: no need for apologies  but thanks for reading. looking forward to all future tweaks/features!,FEATURE
2627,ups and downs my interest my jawbone up band rises and falls very quickly. some days it's great some days i could care less. eventually you get used to the alarm feature on the band and you miss your alarm some days.,OTHER
2628,good its good bt i think outfit 7should add more features  maybe make it mor interesting but...not wierd!ok,FEATURE
2629,much better as a shop owner  this app used to lack necessary functionality on the go.  much better features now!  .,FEATURE
2630,nice features with some ugly creepers some of the art well technically improved is very ugly.  call me shallow  i want to watch pretty pictures.  some of the sounds like the tat spin are grating.  thankfully the expanding wilds are randomly unlocked frequently for those who are seasoned veteran time wasters. otherwise  the slots themes are varied  facebook  and i like the auto spin.  lack of cute  jackpot and faster losses make this my less played app.,USABILITY

2632,good but could've been great i'm leaving this app because of the lack of double tap to zoom to column feature!,FEATURE
2633,terrible..  wish i never purchased this version. first off   the game and story are incredible. the graphics and story have been well adapted for android.  on to the bad part: 1. the dpad is nearly unusable.   with the current dpad system i find myself wasting minutes trying to talk to a moving npc. 2. nowhere in the specifications do they list that they require you to be connected to the internet.  3. when switching between other apps the game is very hit or miss with the autosave feature.   good luck with enjoying the game if you choose to purchase.,USABILITY
2634,? its a gr8 app i recommend it fully but its lack of 2 features as customized scan schedule scan..its very fast scanning gr8 app,FEATURE
2635,great app - but kinks w/ new firmware update :( newest firmware update from verizon has made it impossible to read incoming text messages (black text on black background).  so far am working around this by copying and pasting  but if the problem is not resolved in the near term - i will have to switch to another sms client  and forgo encrypted sms's unless it is absolutely urgent.    it would be great if a feature to preempt this could be developed moving forward :) not much maneuvering can be done on the firmware end.  i've been using this app for about two years though  and on the whole - super happy with it!  expecting this issue to be a temporary kink at most :),BUG
2636,great app! i love this app! it's great to have my book lists with me wherever i go and i can easily keep track of which books i've read to each of my kids. one thing missing is the browse feature like the apple version has; i miss that! add that and i will rate 5 stars!,FEATURE
2637,+1 with download folder and auto-sync folder i miss whole folder download and ability to set folder to sync automatically. otherwise great so far. dropbox is better at these features but lacks at security. spideroak is far behind on this without the ability to upload files.,FEATURE
2638,i love it  but... i use smart launcher for months  i love how it consume less memory than other launchers and without lack of features. but one thing that bothers me sometimes is that the screen transition between home screen and the drawer is not smooth enough. i hope you guys see my review and get it done. overall  5 stars!,PERFORMANCE
2639,good but could be better no landscape preview. locate gopro feature allowed me to recover a ?1000+ quadcopter and hero3black from 20' up a completely different hedge top that i thought it had ditched into.  invaluable feature.,OTHER
2640,lack of important functions 1/ you can not select multiple images to send at once in this same application. 2/ you can not send photos to friends they didn't move to telegram yet. 3/ no option for copying a fragment of a message. 4/ no automatic sending of any media if the connection is established again (you have to do it manually). not to mention that these features are available in whatsapp. implement these and you will be a serious challenger and gain 5 stars.,FEATURE
2641,amazing i think you should add the flag button  anyway really well done interface  a lot of attention for graphic experience details. the features work smooth and fast. this is how apps should be made.,FEATURE
2642,android un-friendly the app is significantly less developed than its ios counterpart  and the lack of chromecast support is a glaring omission of one of the fundamental features of an android video experience.,FEATURE
2643,blunt tool when you need it to be sharper lack of ability to view users video list  stilted playback (no landscape pre play layout?) and search features that can't index or list newly uploaded videos frustrate no end. please please take this back to the drawing board.,FEATURE
2644,great fun and free!! very atmospheric game. great sound and graphics. have been comments about the lack of a save feature but on a game this short a save option would have made things too easy. would thoroughly recommend.,OTHER
2645,annoying app the content is useful  the interface is poor. the text selection feature often disrupts reading accidentally when scrolling  so i lose my place. the black background is annoying  should have option to change to white,USABILITY
2646,this is the one. i have tried sooo many launchers for my nexus 7  buying a few in desperation  and i've always been frustrated at one or usually more lack of features. i'm using the oriental theme for sslauncher and this is now the tablet i've wanted all along. easy and/or customizable. thank you.,OTHER
2647,critically broken logic it baffles me how good this app potentially is but the lack of updates to add basic features is dissapointing. recurring options are poor  lacks even basic task search capability  no location based reminders  terrible sorting. if you have more than 10todos they can easily become a mess.  i have at if least 100 tasks and lists and it is a pita to try to find something.  if the daily plan option wasnt so good this might be one of the worst todo apps there is....,FEATURE
2648,beautiful design  missing key functionality although any.do is great to look at - clean  simple  and elegant - it is missing some necessary functionality.  for example  you cannot reorder folders or subtasks.  my biggest disappointment is the lack of location-based reminders in the android application - which was it's most intriguing feature and the one that differentiated it from other task managers.  i will keep an eye on this and i look forward to future updates.,FEATURE
2649,straightforward  useful very useful for what it should do  and the basic functionality is great. i do like the any.do moment feature  which asks you to plan out your day. the interface for the companion calendar  cal  is incredible  while any.do is just decent - nothing special. the big complaint i have  then  is a lack of sub-tasks  and a relatively difficult interface for viewing or editing anything more than a task title (e.g. notes or locations or reminders are all a tad difficult to access). overall  though  not bad at all,FEATURE
2650,good but expecting more features when something is good we expect more. same here. i was looking for a gtd app which is always with me and can remind me time to time. so this app is better than many other gtd apps. what i miss here; 1) shared list/folder : i need to share a task every time. what if i make a shared folder. 2) no planning for routine or repeated tasks : i can't skip particular task from planning. so i am supposed to set time for routine task on every planning. which is panic. 3) manual planning : if i had set timing for day planning  it always pop up that time  even if i have already done it manually.  i hope these issues/features would be noticed earlier. as a developer i can say that they are easy to implement.,FEATURE
2651,should have great app and nice features like increasing brightness of scanned pages and option to scan only in black and white mode and many more great features,OTHER
2652,great customization  but old and outdated the keyboard has excellent customization  but it lack a feature to learn new words automatically  and the ui are old,FEATURE
2653,horrible installed perfectly and though was great app. uploaded some pics from gallery with no problem. when wanted to take a pic as demo here shows above  it was just a black scree. pressed camera button  nothing. can upload from gallery  but cant use the main feature of this app which is what is advertised. why would i use this to upload from my phone? my phone hasd bluetooth  and a usb to hook up to my pc. i can send those pics via text  email  and facebook. the main purpose of this app does not work!,BUG
2654,missing some stuff i just miss home button (which could be added above navigation buttons in tabs panel)  quick access to fullscreen and user-agent in options bar and ability to choose external sd card as default download location. i'm still gonna give it 5 stars but it would be awesome to include at least some of these features :),USABILITY
2655,amazing amazing game!!!.. they should add a feature where you can buy different characters though!,FEATURE
2656,add save feature. three times now i've sunk endless hours into this game only to have to reinstall and lose everything. i miss playing but there is no point if everytime you reinstall our get a new phone you have to start from scratch.,BUG
2657,need to add a feature you guys should add a custom car builder feature where you can just build your own car but every part you buy will just keep adding up your total overall great app its fun and it kills time,FEATURE
2658,it's kind of cool.  it needs to be able to hold more pics in a slide show. 24 is no where near enough! on the filters  i'd like to be able to use 2 or 3 on 1 pic. it only allows for 1.  the ink sketch filter looks like a bunch of black ants crawling all over your teeth. kind of nasty.  i love the caption feature  but i'd really love it if you could change color  font size & style & where it's positioned on the pic. all in all it makes pretty cool pics.,FEATURE
2659,no date i love the crescendo feature. the alarm is very effective. not too disturbing   not too subtle. however i cannot program it to go off on a certain date and therefore i still miss important events because i have to rely on the useless calendar alarm :s,FEATURE
2660,really useful! this is by far the best price checking app i've tried. great design  easy to use.  however  i miss the option to not get messages about discounts in general  but only apps on the watch list.  edit: it seems like they added my request! besides  other great features  such as app screenshots  have come with this update. nothing to complain about now :d,OTHER
2661,awesome please add feature for encryption before being uploaded to cloud. having to encrypt elsewhere causes extra work and security risk. your app is a life and space saver. way to be green. i do agree with enhancement improvement is needed.anti shake would be helpful. the digi level is laggy. using advanced image options causes black screen and have to restart process. also please add option to join scans. scan seems to lose quality when further away  this makes receipts a little tough so adding   joined scans will keep quality.,SECURITY
2662,it's okay so what i dislike about this app is that the base drum is in front of the snare drum so it's kind of hard to tap the base drum repeatedly and keep a steady rhythm with the snare. i think you should add a feature that lets you move the parts to wherever is more comfortable for you. another thing that i have a problem with is that the snare drum is too small on phones. i have a galaxy s3 and it has a pretty big screen but it's still pretty hard to tap the snare at a fast pace with one finger.,FEATURE
2663,the best calendar app! this is my one and only calender.  it saved me from the frustration of every other calenders lack of functionality.  the drag and drop feature is excellent and a must have for me. i found it even better than the native iphone calender(ios 6) and much better than the new iphone calender (ios 7) .   the level of customization is awesome yet extremely user friendly. thank you for developing this app! this calender was a huge reason i be was able to switch from iphone to droid because it's essential for my job,OTHER
2664,wont play my mp4 videos (9.17.12)this used to be a great app. after the update  i cant play videos anymore.. i switched to mobo player too. geez im going to miss the zoom feature.. (4.21.14)i re-installed this app  this time the mp4 files play but the avi files has black polka dots on the screen. mkv files still doesnt play.,BUG
2665,crashes frequently intuitive and feature-rich  but crashes frequently on my asus transformer  including every time waking up from sleep. i just get a black screen and have to close and reopen the app.,BUG
2666,seems to work on my htc one replaces the only feature on my s3 that i missed.  only used it for 5 mins  but seems to do what it says. i'm sitting in a reasonably dark room  i turned the timeout down to 15 secs. point the phone away from me and the screen goes black after 15 secs. point the phone at me and the screen doesn't go off.  upgraded to the pro version  and the continuous scan mode doesn't seem to work (but then it is labelled beta) - but.. well app seems to do what it does in the description.,BUG
2667,excellent calculator this is an excellent floating calculator  in spite of some (minor) shortcomings. it has all the features that one would want in a small calculator that can be used while one is using other apps. the lack of memory functions is easily overcome with the use of parentheses  and with these  the copy function is more than adequate for most purposes. one useful feature which it does not have at the moment  is the ability to paste/insert data copied from  say  a text file. this would make it possible to use earier results stored in a text file. nevertheless  this is an excellent app  and the developer should be congratulated for a job well done  and for generously making it available a no cost.,FEATURE
2668,nice interface but still lack of features especially ability to sync across devices or at least autobackup to sd  ability to add account like bank/cash/credit  and custom date to date overview.,FEATURE
2669,nice design but lack many important features such as current balance  wallet  budget  saving plans .. i hope you guy will come up with more features later :),FEATURE
2670,great application i miss a couple of features from the web version but still it is very good. it would be nice if it wouldn't freeze for couple of seconds when the network connection is poor. all in all it's a very good for learning new language.,FEATURE
2671,overall good. in general experience on app is good. pleasant to eye and lag-proof thing. although i do miss that feature of new concept which is present on web version of duolingo. hope to see it get added soon.,FEATURE
2672,? best home around... tried several others. author should add some more features and charge $ for it. well worth money now! moto droid.,OTHER
2673,implement automatic discovery i love the app  but i miss the feature to automatically discover macs on the local network. such feature will be great and will enable users to set it up much easily. also you won't need to check your mac's ip every time when you need to connect  especially on a different network. (maybe add it by mac address);,FEATURE
2674,good idea... there are better apps that provide these features. playing ads all night  having to keep the screen on the whole time  and lack of calibration makes me want to look elsewhere.,FEATURE
2675,ui is almost perfect  nearly there on features. title basically says what needs to be said. in terms of ui and basic usability this app is unbeatable  though i wish the dark theme were a little more palatable and that the plain theme made more use of color. i'd like to be able to cut/paste tasks and still determine my own indentation hierarchy within the due date sorting scheme as well. as the service is now it has become essential on my device  but there's still a ways to go. the app suffers from a lack of granularity  especially in widget list selection. the addition of sharing from other apps more smoothly is a hugely welcome one  and it's good to see this app continuing to improve.,FEATURE
2676,awesome but: miss a very critical feature. for me i really miss exchange integration. will be great to have mt office tasks in its own list.   set reminders by location will be great as well.  happy to pay slightly more for these two features.,FEATURE
2677,? lack a bit of advanced features  but overall great app for tracking,FEATURE
2678,disapointed this app crashes more than before and the widget is still broken. the built in browser is a burdon with its lack of features. this is a terrible replacement for the original google reader .,BUG
2679,very easy and fun not many programs deserve a 5 star but this is one of them. i do miss some features (or maybe i just don't know how to use the app) like continue reading from my last page ad it sometimes reloads from start with me articles but overall this is a very good app. thanks guys!,FEATURE
2680,works great i still kinda miss greader   but feedly did manage to pump in some new  welcome features.,FEATURE
2681,beats google reader feedly has definitely filled in for google reader and went beyond with added features  and incorporates cross-platform capability with feedly cloud. there are a few quirks with the app  such as starting the app and having to log back in every once and awhile  or the lack of response when refreshing for new articles  but looking past those shortcomings  it's a great replacement to the former king  google reader.,BUG
2682,great app this is a great app. i've had a lot of fun playing with all the features. but for some reason the frames black out my picture. still a great photo editing app!,BUG
2683,sound engineering! these people do really know sound. but still lack certain features. so 4 stars. first important feature is enque option.,FEATURE
2684,good app...but... not having folder mapping is a dealbreaker. as pretty and good as this app is  the lack of that one feature keeps me with aquamail.,FEATURE
2685,great app has good feature set to begin with. but i found the lack of 2 step authenticated sign-ons a let down. though accessing app accounts at once is available  switching between accounts requires more touches compared to peer apps. currently seems to be supporting many type of email providers for free and with no restrictions on number of accounts which is an excellent thing.,USABILITY
2686,not so grand the features are great if they work  which unfortunately is nearly never. constantly loses connection to the server when i'm on stable wifi  crashes continuously  doesn't keep up the stream to chat and doesn't like to load lootables at all. this app hasn't been updated in over a year and it's easy to see the lack of support.,BUG
2687,awesome browsing speed my only problem is that the browser doesn't seem to remember form data. i'm hoping i have overlooked something and this browser doesn't lack such a basic feature..,FEATURE
2688,should add bowling awesome!!!!!!but.....should add few features like player stats bowling team managment.if all these are added it will be d best android cricket game,FEATURE
2689,great great twitter app  but i really miss share feature from tweet detail. starring tweets also don't work  now!,FEATURE
2690,wtf! new version doesn't support lists? tweetlanes was my favourite client because i can read my lists! that feature coped with the lack of other basic ones like notifications or autocomplete. removing lists is nonsense. i'll have to take a look at the code and see what happened  now that it's been open sourced.,FEATURE
2691,good one complain is lack on notifications. when this feature will be implemented it will be one of best twitter clients in market.,FEATURE
2692,best twitter client! if you are looking for the best twitter client  search no more. this is it! it's similar to tweetbot on ios. you get all the great features from pull to refresh  inline images  column views  white/black holo theme background  tap to jump to top  and so much more. oh and there are no ads in this version. it is simply amazing.,OTHER
2693,frustrating lack of features requested long ago. the lack of ability to save magazines to the external sd card is why i rarely use this anymore. it's ridiculous that i am forced to save to my 8gb of internal space when i have a 64gb microsd card installed.  inability to remove multiple issues at once is frustrating too.,FEATURE
2694,simple and easy great app. to the point. crisp and easy to use. loses a star cause of lack of features; gains a star for being truly free. no ads.  all features are unlocked.,FEATURE
2695,could have been great! !! the app is really cool. but it lack some basic feature like deleting the categories we don't use and the vibration on app lock is very much annoying. looking forward to see it from developer,FEATURE
2696,xelent 5 stars r very less for dis  i would like to give more but u should add one feature. we should be able to change d pic of gallery and music    otr wise    gr88,FEATURE
2697,excellent but needs modifications hi team. done pretty well job but should add a small feature to set wallpaper which will appear over all tiles...   done excellent job...,FEATURE
2698,lab and staring place problem i miss some google maps feature in gingerbread. like lab  distance counter. and that we can star a place to our maps,FEATURE
2699,good app works great. sometimes gps signal can take a minute to pinpoint my location. also  i miss the places feature.. searching for restaurants and businesses takes a lot longer without it.. bring it back google!,PERFORMANCE
2700,a beautiful and efficient app with one glaringly annoying flaw... this is what got me to a smartphone in the first place  and it remains the best of the best. i miss the labs features  but i like the current incarnation. thanks for putting the scale bar back in but why does it disappear? a map (especially one that zooms and pans) needs a scale bar. keep it visible and i can give you back that 5th star.,FEATURE
2701,why google? i can understand the refreshed look but why remove so many features that could be enabled? like zoom buttons  the double tap and now backwards slide to zoom is so unnatural. measure? larger areas to download for offline? miss the old and google gets a thumbs down,FEATURE
2702,pretty good i read the other reviews about v7 of maps & don't really understand why people don't like it or think some features are gone. navigation  searching nearby  accuracy  compass  etc...all work fine for me. yes  things are in new places but once you're used to the new interface it's actually very user friendly. i will agree the lack of zoom in/out buttons is annoying but that's minor. i use this app extensively for exploring & searching both home & away and find it very useful & accurate.,OTHER
2703,ui nice  but missing features i used to love this app. newer version missing key functions  esp labs - i miss zoom buttons!!  can't pinch-zoom with 1 hand  & double-tap/slide is frustrating! :(   wish nav offered alternate routes like online version (no tolls  etc) .,FEATURE
2704,missing features i miss the navigation icon as well as the option to remove certain routes in the directions. please bring this feature back!!!,FEATURE
2705,do not update... if you're like me & miss all the great features from the last google maps. i have found the answer. anyone looking to going back to v6.14.4 before the update please email me at: nemichoco@gmail.com,FEATURE
2706,please just bring back the old maps!! how do you update a software and take away all the good features  while not adding any new ones?  i miss so many things.  the button that shows my entire route in nav  the option for other routes  the option to search while in nav for things in my route  the option to just view the map while nav is still running separately.  i use the gps a lot for work and this update is killing me.  i need old version of maps please,FEATURE
2707,? why can i not see bus stop id's like i used to be able to? i had the galaxy. first one. now i have a moto x. its very difficult being on the road and attempting to find public transit on the fly and all i have to go on is intersecting streets and a rough estimate of where stops should be! and thats even if gps is working. i miss being able to see actually names of buildings and whatnot. helped find get my bearings and such. please bring back the old google maps. hate that i have to use the web browser everytime i want to travel. the feature of adding stop by stop was good. but i feel its become way to simplistic. i'm not always going to have gps and perhaps i do have access to it  doesn't mean i want to use it. i should be able to locate where i am and where i want to go and get directions that shows everything!  from actual streets to bus stops and shelters along the way. i used to be able to click on the blue bus symbol and it told me when the next bus would be coming. not to mention when all possible routes would be passing through.,FEATURE
2708,good with some serious shortcomings i really liked mark's book and the app is a great helper for the daily workout. however  i really miss some features:  - the ability to save changed workout plans. i have some injuries and thus have to change a number of exercises. however those changes are not saved; press the back button once too much and the changes are lost. actually  i gave up on that and now often just use the app as a glorified workout timer  substituting the workouts with my owns. its really a pity.  - of course  it would be cool would the progress data be saved in a cloud somewhere  for if i switch devices.  - also  i am not a bug fan of the user interface style; sometimes less is more  i think. but that's a matter of taste i think.,FEATURE
2709,auto download not working for me the auto download feature seems hit and miss for me  with some podcasts downloading and others not.  i can't figure it out and i've frankly given up.  it's a shame  since this is otherwise a really nice app.,BUG
2710,excellent really great app  much better than other bus apps. the data is sometimes poor  but this is not the app's fault. looses 1 star as it occasionally force closes on launch (but isn't really a problem as it auto-reloads).   feature requests: buses moving along the google maps in real time; colour in times that i can easily walk to (from current gps) in green  ones i have to run to in orange and ones i'll miss in red.,FEATURE
2711,integration of emails is nice. would like more features  coming from ms exchange  the lack of features is a bit frustrating. unable to organize at the level i am used to. could use automation festured.  un,FEATURE
2712,good application best news application  it should add a feature of notification also @-}--,FEATURE
2713,great launcher after trying many launchers i have accidentally bumped into this app. after using it i was satisfied with the features provided(while most of the popular one's either lack or restrict them to their pro versions) and gorgeous look of the launcher. i definitely recommend every body out there to try it out,OTHER
2714,this is getting rediculous!!!  so much wasted potential and time... i gave this a better review because after months i was finally promised some actual resolution... and that was days ago... and as is becoming the trend with gameloft... nothing has changed or been done to actually resolve the situation.  what is fundamentally a great game  and one of the best on google play worthy of 3-4 stars is mired in poor customer service  that is double the 'three days' promised when contacting them.   what leads to the largest number of complaints and the sole cause of most issues  as well as keeping this from being a 4-5 star game is a lack of any sort of way to save your game and progress across devices  installs or in case of hardware/software failure.  don't spend money unless you don't mind potentially losing it... because if you ask for a refund when you do  you get promised credited gems... that i'm almost certain i won't recieve for at least a month if at all as past experience has shown.  i've stopped spending money on gameloft at all.  any app  in app purchases... even on games with a save feature... what is the point of supporting them financially when they clearly do not actually care about the customers?  i give up.  buyer beware!,FEATURE
2715,some features aren't available gold box deals take longer to update once available and there is no option to join wait list on deals. it might not be a problem on regular days  but it did annoy me on black friday  when i missed some deals. it is fair to join wait list on smartphone app and get notification  whereas waiting in front of browser for the whole time.  old review: simple enough to search and shop. only thing i wish it had was an option to save password. i hate putting password every time  but its understandable!,FEATURE
2716,almost perfect! it lacks some feature. there is something they should add to make the app better.,FEATURE
2717,great app and great books i love the black background feature and the idea of free books is really awesome....,OTHER
2718,i love wattpad! i love wattpad and i use it everyday  both to read and write. i love the new inline comments feature  but i am missing something i used to use quite often  automatic scrolling. it was nice to snuggle under the covers and not that to leave the warmth to scroll down or flip the page. i noticed on the wattpad website where it says take wattpad on the go the iphone version has the scrolling options  why doesn't my android.i also miss the option of having it set to both scroll & page flip.,USABILITY
2719,it's great! latest updates improved app significantly. i still miss an old feature where you could change both background and text colours.,FEATURE
2720,holy crap i lack the words to describe just how amazing this is on 4.1+. seriously  i've tried to explain it to people who haven't used it  and i just can't. i fail as an orator.  pretty pointless on older android versions though. although i have to wonder what the typical 1 star trolls are going on about battery use. the amount of my battery this uses is almost nonexistent. and complaining that an optional opt-in feature is running in the background when its entire purpose is to run in the background is just stupid.,OTHER
2721,? looks sharp  works well  but the lack of customization makes it mediocre. not uninstalling yet... will wait for an update and hope for more features.,FEATURE
2722,keep to one theme love the features  everything works well  but please make it look better! change the loading thing to a simple grey circle  and make the app icon flatter and simpler. also  the green in the logo doesn't fit in. i would make the overall theme flat & grey/white  and make the black toolbars grey. and change that loading thing!,OTHER
2723,excellent app! but add more! this is much better than samsung's equation detection but the only thing missing in this app is the lack of variety. just like in the note 10.1  please add more equations and have the ability to solve complex algebra. i'll be glad to pay for such a feature. makes work so much easier!,FEATURE
2724,horrible  lacking  & crashes! paid for this last night and wish i hadn't. the app has very limited features. no realistic audio. no customizations  and on top of that is buggy  and crashes. now i just get a black screen. refund please!,FEATURE
2725,hate new update i loved this app and used it regularly before the new update  now it's useless.i miss the previous ease of translating back and forth to make sure the translation was saying what i wanted it to  which always helped me catch errors in the phrasing of what i was trying to translate. unless the next update brings back the now missing features  i'm going top have to uninstall since this app is now useless to me.,FEATURE
2726,good client this does what i need it to do. keep it lean. plenty of feature-clogged apps out there  but i like this. i also liked the black & white icon by the way.,OTHER
2727,the best design but that's all holo design and customizeable in this small app. most important thing about twitter is refreshing which is incredibly slow in tweedle because it download 3+ hour twit. should have option to limit to 25 or 50 tweet or by time like at most 1 hour tweet. quiet miss using this for inline image and auto expand twitlonger but can't stand the slow load and lost other important point for twitter management is add people to list. i need pict saving but okay since this only additional feature,PERFORMANCE
2728,great idea  nice ui ... but the photo dismiss feature is a little inaccurate. i tested by taking a photo of my sink as the trigger  then i was able to dismiss the alarm by taking a photo of my pillow. i had photo accuracy set to high while testing. keep up the good work and keep the improvements coming. also... users  beware that if you have this app installed on your device  it will silence all other alarm apps. so you might be late to work. at least - that's what happened to me.,PERFORMANCE
2729,urgent please help!!! i've forgotten the pattern lock key  can you please help? half of my phone's locked and am stuck! i loved the features of ur app  but by far ur services have been very poor! i wrote a mail to u 4 days ago and haven't heard back! even the general settings of my phone are locked  along with the play store  text messages and more! please help!!! its impossible to use a phone in this state! its a 5 star app  but ur lack of help is bothering me...,OTHER

2733,i won't update the pc version interface is burdensome now and i do not like it. hence i will hold off updates here until they force me... which they do. i really miss my sms alerts. why   they take away features is beyond me. this is now my spam account.,FEATURE
2734,? good app - not great but better than i have seen from google chrome website and going to yahoo mail without the app  just the website .  for my desk top  i do use google chrome or firefox and it works great. but for my samsung galaxy tablet   i prefer the android yahoo email app. there are some features that i wish were different. primarily  i miss being able to open multiple emails at the same time. i have been used to this email more so than gmail  and because the wife uses yahoo mail  it will be my primary mail app.,FEATURE
2735,widget i think the implementation of some type of widget would make this application perfect. anything to where it could be displayed on the home screen. i think that to use the widget you would be required to have a device password (pin  pattern etc.) other than the lack of a widget feature i am so thankful for this service and the app works great!,FEATURE
2736,superb app! i have supported jared since the beginning and he never fails to disappoint!!! amazing app and simply the best dev out there!!! buy it now if you haven't already - you will be very glad you did and will support an absolutely amazing developer!! seems to lack a little bit of functionality included with tb pro but i still prefer to use rom toolbox because the ui is so much better. be nice to have some tb pro features but superb!!!,FEATURE
2737,useful app but needs an upgrage the app is very useful and easy to operate but could you guys add a sort of night mode option such that a white background in a text document turns black and a plain text turns white instead. its a lot more easier to read such texts at night. many apps do have this feature.,FEATURE
2738,poor performance & features this is not expected from adobe. poor performance & lack of features. there are better readers available with good performance & features.,PERFORMANCE

2747,great app great work  easy to use  the ui is beautiful  but i miss a few features  such as  - ability to import the exported csv files  - incomes  what can manually set the monthly limit (whenever a new income is added  current months limit is raised)  - add recurring expenses (and incomes)  monthly  weekly  annual  biannual  etc.  - google account sync maybe for the settings and information stored?  otherwise  so far the best and easiest to use expense manager app!,FEATURE
2748,smooth  simple and easy to use this is exactly what i've been looking for - a clean  clear ui; easy input; an uncluttered summary view and a nice  simple design. a spot on app for managing my expenses - well worth the ?1.99 i paid for the premium features.  one minor issue i have is the lack of back button functionality. i seem to always forget that it takes me right out of the app  rather than to the precious screen. but this /is/ just a minor nitpick.,FEATURE
2749,perfect note pad well i had a palm pilot before the smartphone and one feature i miss is the ability to just write on the screen.  while this app won't do that  it does bring up a nice notepad to type things on and there's color coding and home screen icons for notes you use a lot...like a shopping lust or workout schedule.,FEATURE
2750,wd mobile app is good  but still needs work.. the apps work fine  the drive works very well.  the integration with the mobile apps seem to lack features like most.  ie would be great to backup  contacts  email   phone configuration  text messages and other types of content.      i have to use multiple apps to give me all that i ask  it would be nice to have a all in one with a cloud device. keep up the good work and please consider adding more features and content.,FEATURE
2751,a fine piece of software that offers an interesting feature viral is a nice little video viewer that offers users a sweet capability - a pop-out viewer. this is nice  but it pales in comparison to another advantage - its remarkable stability and lack of slow-loading  unlike the far-worse youtube android app.,OTHER
2752,massieko this is the best ocarina app i've used on android thus far. it worked great on my lg optimus black other than not being able to use the blow feature. unfortunately it doesn't support more than two touches on my new htc one x,OTHER
2753,suggestions  comprehensive an incredibly solid start. there are some quirks and bugs (that aren't suuuper major) and an overall lack of features  but the base here is startlingly fresh and good. the lack of gesture support and more icon customization  as well as a way to hide the settings page (tucking it away in a gesture  overflow menu somewhere  or separate app shortcut) make it difficult to leave nova launcher. here are my suggestions  and what it would take to make me switch:  - customize app icons on long-press  individually. applying a theme is great  but they rarely cover 100% of all apps  and the inconsistency drives me mad.  - gesture support. i love being able to swipe down anywhere and pulling down my notification shade  or swiping up for my app drawer  etc.  - customization of panels. i'd like to be able to decide if i want a full apps list  or the launcher settings  and be able to decide where they are located.  i have already purchased the pro key  so i'm excited to see if these features get implemented. i currently run a custom setup i made for myself in nova launcher mimicking the google now aesthetic  but having it in launcher form would be 10x better. good luck!,FEATURE
2754,it is what it is its a good app  i wish it would show the real feel on the widget. also wish it had the same feature as my old one did where it gave full screen animation... i miss that.,FEATURE
2755,? i miss the custom tab feature in the drawer  i use that all the time  it makes my use of the phone much faster. otherwise it's a very good launcher and it's free.,FEATURE

2759,greedy app  seeks more money when you have the chance to make your gift to art progress  you should honor that blessing. selling a guitar learning tool  and then limiting the features to sell more and more 'pro' versions  is showing your lack of respect to music. deceiving is bad. ambition kills culture.,OTHER
2760,great reddit client i've tried many android reddit clients and bacon reader is my favorite  far and away. i especially like the black theme since i try to run a lot of dark-themed apps for battery savings. it has all the features you'd want in a reddit client and is smooth/sleek.,OTHER
2761,good app  has some issues i miss the coach feature  which is available on ios. gps lacks accuracy. otherwise quite good.,PERFORMANCE
2762,good features  needs maps i l iike most things about this app. the primary weakness is the lack of a map while running. also it would be great if it could track all works  line cycling  swimming  weights etc.,FEATURE
2763,great app i installed it a few days ago but whenever i open challenges  screen goes black subsequently the app crashes. otherwise it is fine. adding tips or coach feature would be great.,FEATURE
2764,lack of common sense you gave away go launcher prime free for 24h back in december 2013. you said it is free  but now all features disappeared and i am prompted to buy it again.  what happens?,OTHER
2765,slow  no point. the viewfinder display is really laggy and slow.  doesn't seem to offer any creative black and white features so how does it improve over just desaturating color photos?,PERFORMANCE

2767,an excellent offline rss reader on my nexus 7. a solid  simple  lightweight reader. the only feature i miss compared with my desktop reader is the ability to group feeds in folders. thanks are due to the author.  this is an open source program and there are similar apps based on it. if you have one of these installed  as i had  uninstall it first or you get a 'duplicate' error.  this is not a web-based reader like google reader  but you can import your feeds as an opml file.,FEATURE
2768,party feature overall the game is fun  but it lack of one feature where u can party with friends and race with other random people if not when there is only 2 or 3 friends online  they cant play in a 4 person race. hope u guys can implement this features! thanks..,FEATURE
2769,excellent dialer replacement (+) quick & good-looking (+) dialpad tones are on the media channel  not the ringtone channel - so  not as loud for me (+) good choice of colours for theming (+) don't need android 4.4 for the web search feature (-) lack of auto-rotate support,FEATURE
2770,good app layout i like the app layout but i miss the old color scheme the menu and features and operation of the app is really good but i miss that blue on black color scheme now its orange on black and i don't like that as much  update: thanks for adding more color options. i'm now giving you a full 5 stars. thanks!!,OTHER
2771,great idea in theory i like the idea of predictive texting  however the flow feature simply isn't very effective when you make mistakes (and you will make mistakes once in a while).  swype and google keyboard have a much better and more accurate way to say what you are trying to say even if you miss a key or two.  i actually found that i wanted more options for word choice rather than predictive options since lifting my finger to select the predictive word really took about the same amount of time as completing the word.,PERFORMANCE
2772,great keyboard  needs some tweaks so far i've been switching back and forth between this and google keyboard on my xt1080. would like to see the following features: 1) disable auto-correct in the chrome url bar; 2) disable automatic entry of space after autocorrect and suggested word insertion (makes inserting punctuation easier); 3) improve detection of objects blocking the keyboard  for example my bank app places a black settings bar at the bottom of the screen that blocks the bottom row of the swiftkey  but not google  keyboard.,FEATURE
2773,vast improvement since i last used and gave it 2 stars it has come a long way since then  now it is my default keyboard for galaxy note 2. the only feature i miss from my oem keyboard is the s-pen write to text conversion. but overall lots on improvement.   now waiting for minuum keyboard to launch in android store.,FEATURE
2774,nice nice keyboard  used it for years with no issues but there is now a lack of innovation compared to other keyboard apps. i remember there being some talk of an emoji capability being built in and that was months ago now  with emoji capability built into android now this should be a main feature. i would like to keep using this keyboard but will switch to another if there isn't an update soon,FEATURE
2775,nope. sadly this one-trick pony just got put out to pasture. the new kii has taken over. i do miss my predicted text  but kii offers a lot more than a single feature. sorry swiftkey  you have miles of ground to make up and flow isn't going to cut it. users want a more customized keyboard.,FEATURE
2776,multiwindows?i love the app! especially it's  ability to insert videos into the notebook. one  of the best apps for students studying for oral exams.   it would surclass even samsung's spen app if it would have multiwindow features .  i only  give it a 4 because of the lack of multiwindows,FEATURE
2777,not user friendly not user friendly anymore i really miss being able to swipe over to my notifications from my timeline can you please restore this feature also tweet button > tweet bar the  i also have a constant unread bubble on my notification timeline  button with 1 unread even though i have clearly read all my notifications. can you change it back to when it worked and flowed  twitter? don't ruin what you had its even worse with ever update -_- what happened twitter,FEATURE

2779,cool user inrerface finally!! you guys have done it right  i never see my old avatar in my profile after updated it anymore  i can change the profile bio directly in the app  new feature send pics via dm is good. and the best is i truly loved the new ui  but miss the last blue color and to scroll from timeline to connect/ mention. regards - sony xperia j users,OTHER
2780,i miss pc... missing features: set font size; set file priorities. bugs: stops downloading for no reason; sometimes it used the phone memory instead of the sdcard  even though it's configured correctly.,FEATURE
2781,? good  but it should add more features in the free version,FEATURE
2782,something you need i voted 4 stars because i think u should add a feature that let's you choose a skin that you downloaded on your device. if u add that i will give 5 stars,FEATURE
2783,waaay 2 slow on notifications! twitter is like a chat.. so when twidere decides to alert me to a mention on twitter it comes 20 to 30 minutes after the person has composed the message! worse yet i cant change how frequently to check my account for updates.  some good features like twit longer added to this app... but severely let down on lack of additional user features around how you are notified... when... with what tone.. etc fox this and we might be dealing with a decent app,FEATURE
2784,you can't deposit checks with the android i'm disappointed in the features with the android vs the iphone when it comes to the chase app. i miss being able to take a picture of checks and i have to continue to hit the return to go back to the account screen. i think i'm spoiled by my iphone apps.,OTHER
2785,? great reddit app. the devs should add some res like features.,FEATURE
2786,lack of updates and features what happened to this glorious launcher. lack of updates and features. are the developer has already abonded this awesome launcher and let it be a vaporware. somebody should take over this developer project and make this glorious launcher back to life.,FEATURE
2787,dude on samsung galaxy s4 install the application on my phone and it consistently fails to operate. specifically  everytime i open it it causes with a black screen and then i get an error message informing me that it will not function. i have tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the product with the same failed results. from the product video i like the features and i hope that this is a temporary setback for my model of phone.,BUG
2788,piece of crap since update the new version does no longer allow you to save favorites  i really miss this feature. furthermore  on e.g. lock/unlock of your phone  switch between apps etc the app reloads the view and starts at the top of the page again. very annoying and expensive when on roaming.,FEATURE
2789,come on  developers! the ad banner constantly pushes the buttons off screen  making the game unplayable! this used to be a rare happening  but now is most of the time! would also be nice if you could actually win on the double up feature instead of constantly bearing dealt cards smaller than the face-up card. i sure miss this game being playable!,USABILITY
2790,mostly pretty happy like this app a lot.  but miss  being able to delete the crossed off items and leave the rest.  any chance of getting that feature back?,FEATURE
2791,great app love the- my list feature.  i can find the best deals and plan my black friday shopping trip,OTHER
2792,best app in class. needs some updates. having tried various other similar services for android i have come back to rtm.  its a very flexible and mature product with seamless sync. it costs $25 a year for pro but for me its worth every penny. it loses a star for the aging web interface (though i like the key shortcuts)  lack of any official import/export features  lack of proper subtasks and a little sign of any new features from the developers. however it is still in my view the best option available.,FEATURE
2793,costly upgrade ui feels outdated!!  25$ for sync alone is too pricey. google tasks works well for me but miss features like smart add & search.,OTHER
2794,simple and fun to use love sharing routes with friends and tracking my progress. i don't use all the features but like what i do use.    would give 5 stars but miss seeing my pace on the android app. since i dont run with my phone i enter info manually. i enter distance and time but the app no longer displays the pace...seems an obvious one to include.,FEATURE
2795,good app  but lacks important updates i love this app. it does exactly what it's suppose to do. it tracks runs  bike rides  and other forms of moving exercises. the data is quick to get to and the running screen is easy to read and see all the important info at a glance.  unfortunately  they're slow with updating the app to use android's latest features. specifically bluetooth low energy for heart rate monitors. i understand not everyone is on android 4.3+ but for those of us who are  the lack of ble support is discouraging  given how important heart rate info can be when training. for this reason  i've moved over to mapmyfitness which supports bluetooth low energy heart rate monitors. once runkeeper brings in ble support  i'll switch back as i like the app better.,FEATURE
2796,works well but lacks functionality  abandoned by the devs? pocket casts used to be my go-to podcatcher  however it's falling behind in features compared to the other well known podcatching apps  ie. you can't read the show notes for a podcast without first downloading and playing the episode. there also hasn't been an update since february 2012 and the ui badly needs a redesign to fit in with ics/jb. the lack of updates leads me to believe that the developers have abandoned this app in favour of their new ventures  and their ios version of pocket casts.,FEATURE
2797,95% perfect app it's the only podcast app that i can live with. tried literally every other app  but their interface and functionality made me just angry. the only feature i miss in pocket casts is auto-resuming when i connect headphones. we got auto-pause on headphones disconnect  why not make this feature complete? it's very very useful when driving  because i don't have to look at the screen or at the phone at all to do it. please  make this happen :) apart from that the app is amazing  i like everything about it.,FEATURE
2798,cute ... short you guys should add more features ...,FEATURE
2799,great it works but only they should add auto update feature for apps and upload newest versions of apps,FEATURE
2800,good does what it says  but lack in only one thing  it would have been great if it had keep screen on feature in it,FEATURE
2801,best after-astrid to-do app with astrid shutting down  i've been looking for a comparable to do app  and prodo is as close as it gets. prodo doesn't require a sign in  or a yearly fee for more features. it works with swipe  has a very simple to set due date and alarm  and can be added as a widget on your homescreen. the only thing i miss is astrid's sarcastic wit  but maybe prodo will add that too.,FEATURE
2802,fantastic only surpassed by the beta version ;)  sometimes i miss the zoom bubble feature from chrome but that's a minor feature in comparison to everything else.,FEATURE
2803,one missing feature i miss the swipe to switch tabs from chrome. with this it would be my favorite browser.,FEATURE
2804,fast and easy to use so far i find no faults with this excellent browser. i'd recommend it in a second. my only complaint is the lack of gif support  which is a feature from chrome that i miss.,FEATURE
2805,good but not the best should add more features like show poi,FEATURE
2806,almost useless compared to ios lack of feature and videos. the ios version is way better,FEATURE
2807,galaxy note 3 best battery saver. great feature is it will disable the wifi wen we not using and checks for online notifications in some interwells. this is a great idea for those who dont want to miss important notifications becz of wifi off. why not 5 stars:  while using mobile data  if the screen is off  it disables the data connection and not resuming upon when display is on. so we have to activate mobile data manually each time. white list is not working correctely. tested apps: voip discount and websharing lite.,USABILITY
2808,wow new after a month i left and dont play ss due to all of the problems my friends ask me to come back when i open my ss alot of new feature i hope no more lags and miss compute essence,OTHER
2809,extremely basic  more so than stock. the stock moto g app has a nicer interface (subjective) and more features  yet almost all reviews complain about a lack of them.,FEATURE
2810,good additional features required love the software  the multi stop planning is great as is the trip optimisation. a number of multi drop couriers use this as a work tool. i would like to have the option to export saved multi stop journeys to smemo or a tab deliniated file. this app is not happy running in background  bringing back to foreground sometimes results in black screen  does this on both my galaxy s3 and tab2  changing orientation restores - annoying. would like the option of future destinations listed.,FEATURE
2811,lack of essential features please add some features that are essential and doesn't take too much time to be implemented like:   - support to mark bookmarks and read the existents.  - synchronize the recent viewed between different devices.  - if there are different qualities of the videos add the option to disable the hd on devices.,FEATURE
2812,needs more features to be great app really needs some additional features to be great. lack of support for bookmarks can be frustrating. rewinding and fast forwarding sometimes messes up video steam. overall app provides enough to get the job done on a mobile device.,FEATURE
2813,? you should add a gif feature,FEATURE
2814,missing some features this app is somewhat limited compared to the website. there really should be a setting to change text and background settings  white text with a black background is not very easy on the eyes.   i would also like to see more filtering options  for example to find geology stories you have to manually seach through all of the earth & climate articles  on the web site you can filter on just geology.,FEATURE
2815,pretty good it works nicely and keeps up with my classes. only problem is  which i'm not sure if it's their fault or the camtasia software  videos won't go to landscape mode. there is also no way to rewind or fast forward. i find that very frustrating especially if i miss something me teacher said or i just wanted to go over a particular part of the video. these features are active on desktop mode but it would be nice if they were also on mobile.,OTHER
2816,love spotify i love this app. it's my daily companion application when commuting to the office. love the variety of music and the recommendation system is very good to. besides that i miss some features of the ios app and the user experience could be way better. price for premium is okay. keep it up.,FEATURE
2817,filled with issues i love spotify  and for the most part the android version was good  but now it's barely usable and there are still features lacking (metadata still not working over bluetooth). the switch from stars to checkmarks is weird and i miss having my starred playlist automatically updated. it feels like all these changes weren't planned out.,FEATURE
2818,not worth the iphone app sadly  i miss the features of the iphone app.  the downloaded section is great  but we don't have our folder organization anymore  and without the ability to modify playlists this app is merely a music player.,FEATURE
2819,improving rapidly. this app used to be crappy while the service was ok  but recently the app has started receiving updates on a regular basis adding a lot of basic functionality that should have been there from the beginning. now it features landscape support  resume from last position  notification bar controls and save to sd card. however  i still sorely miss a decent widget  easily sortable queues or the extensions found in the desktop app.,FEATURE
2820,great features love this app. adds many new features that i now miss on my regular camera. highly recommended.,FEATURE
2821,lack of some features overall is ok. however lack of some of the convenient features such as save or print the receipt/transaction for record purpose. secondly  favaorite account is only available after  saved it during online webpage  which bring some of the inconvenient.,FEATURE
2822,airplane mode :/ i know you can't do anything about it  but the lack of airplane mode scheduling in kitkat just sucks. other features are very useful.,FEATURE
2823,okay but lack some features some features i would love to see is the ability to log in and being able to see the ratings and comments on memes kinda like the ios version,FEATURE
2824,very well made.. i've nothing against this keyboard. but  if you can add gesture feature like swype  it can be more useful. other than that  please make the symbol be placed at the back of the letters like any other keyboards out there  and add themes to it too! it's just lack some themes and additional settings!,FEATURE
2825,great idea  but a bit flaky i really like the speaking features  especially the ability to hear my upcoming calendar. however  it is very unresponsive  often the snooze/dismiss buttons don't come up or take a long time to come up. it seems to have gotten better in the last few months.,PERFORMANCE
2826,pages don't fill the screen well  with the latest update i'm now able to sign into the app on my galaxy s4  and it's considerably more stable and responsive on my nook hd+  but unfortunately now when i try to read comics the pages only take up about 2/3 of the screen's available real estate with black borders on the left  right  and bottom.  even if i pinch zoom to fill the screen  when i move to the next page it goes back to the original size.  hopefully they can address that issue and then start adding some of the other standard features of comic readers.  update 8/26/13: today's update still doesn't resolve the issue with comics rendering in about 2/3 of the screen.  while i'm happy to see that they've doubled the number of issues you can have offline  the first time i tried to open one the app crashed back to the launcher.  all in all  this app is still completely unusable on android imo.,USABILITY
2827,disappointed i was hoping to see more features and visual enhancements on the new update. not being able to save password makes the app pretty much unusable. very poor space utilization.  avoid bold and big font . it seems like the app is running in accessibility mode for visually impaired. improve charts . the one big miss in my opinion is the trading screen needs to be simpler   so much unnecessary information is being displayed. position should show ask/bid cost and maket values. needs so much work.,USABILITY
2828,didn't get the full features of kit kat my navigation button on nexus 4 still remain in black background.,OTHER
2829,black screen hello   just loaded it really look forward to enjoying the features then it went to black and every time i try it it goes black after 20 minutes.,OTHER
2830,a potentially great game ruined by terrible rules. i am a huge fan of this game's spiritual flash-based internet predecessor  isketch. i was excited when i initially believed sketchit worked more-or-less the same way. unfortunately  this game lacks the structure and discipline of isketch. cheating is rampant due to a lack of a community self-policing feature. the scoring system is unfair to artists who take on the more challenging subjects  rather than abusing the 'skip' feature. abuse of the hint feature does nothing to deter the artist from abusing it  and is even accessible after the word has been guessed. also  nothing differentiates a player who is the second to guess a drawing by only a fraction of a second  from one that has guessed 30 seconds later after several hints. this game's rules seem centered around appeasing the lowest common denominator.  it's not all bad though. the interface of the game is exceptional. the 'top sketches' gallery is a great feature. the responsiveness to my galaxy note's stylus is phenomenal. the game is very well built in almost every technical sense. and bottom line  it's fun to draw.  it's really just that close to being a great game. if it adopted isketch rules  it would be a perfect 5/5.,FEATURE
2831,good app! it has improved a lot recently. one feature that i really miss is the subtitles.,FEATURE
2832,? i wuld have given this app 5 stars if it had two additional features and the font size whad a wider range.this app should have an option for white text on black and it would be nice to be able to highlight and tag something you wanted to find  later.,FEATURE
2833,? nice ...but lack some features need update,FEATURE
2834,? it always says invalid login id password nd sometimes unable to process.. nd it also lack some features like mobile/dth recharge.,FEATURE
2835,more feature needed you should add a feature that could combine 2 or 3 pictures. other than that  i love it. will recommend to my friends.,FEATURE
2836,lack lustre too much time invested in adding useless extra features rather than making this a proper native app. could be a lot better.,OTHER
2837,miss always incognito setting otherwise  great browser. fast with great features. floating window mode is nice to have.,FEATURE
2838,the best! finally  i found the browser whith all the features i ever wanted from android browser. smooth  fast  displays javascript with no problems (opera). nice ui  soft and simple. you can disable the right sliding panel  that's great (dolphin).  the must : firefox sync ! that's a great idea. all of his in a quite light app. i'm happy. i bought pro version. i just miss some more add-ons  such as an adblock  come on !,FEATURE
2839,lack luster really missing a lot of features like the last price. not half as easy to navigate as the ebay app. that said it can be useful but i find myself using the full site.,FEATURE
2840,great memories... i miss playing this game so much.....but for me the slide feature is not very responsive....and my frog dies at times for no reason.,PERFORMANCE
2841,best available it's the best triple triad app available  but that's not saying too much as there is not many on the market. i don't like that there are unoriginal cards in the game. card selection needs to be improved  maybe less cards visible via pages (making them appear larger). there aren't separate difficulties  only quick play. it hasn't been updated in a while  so there is still no store feature. the 5/5 score figure would be nice as well. the menus are nice. i love shuffle & boogie while playing. i understand this is beta  but the lack of updates grants a full review. just below the 4 star marker for me.,FEATURE
2842,i love it! i no longer need more than one homescreen. i can access the same amount of stuff in 3 or 4 screens with the quickdrawer and quickpage feature. covers is brilliant! instead of having a homescreen dedicated to fitness apps i have one cover! i use the shutter feature to access my calendar. with the direct text and direct call shortcuts i don't need my contacts icon. it's super smooth  runs like a champ!   somethings i would like to see!  -notifications! i want my icons to show if i've missed a call or text or if i have a facebook notification.  -the ability to customize the action bar. for example  the size and apps it uses. i love the search feature it presently includes.  -the ability to customize the size of the icons. i do miss this feature  and it is included with just about any other launcher.    -the ability to use either double tap or swipe to access shutter or cover.   issues i had: -i had a hard time making folders! those icons moved around a ton!  -swiping a shutter or cover in the doc bar never worked. had disable to bar.,FEATURE
2843,awesome just excellent! is there a possibility to make it that you can drag the now playing song up when in listview or somewhere else like in google play music? miss that feature,FEATURE
2844,hug the maker of this game lack of commentry and some other feature mentioned by someone before is noticed but gaming experience is good 14.81 mb does't go waste but playing is easy timing matters this is why 2 stars are off,FEATURE
2845,gorgeous  fast  and feature filled love how modern and fluid and aesthetically pleasing this app is. well done dev i must say. keep up the work. thank you for adding indv. notification icon personalization  love that feature. just bought the personalize pack. love the dark and black themes. the layouts are great too. just keeps getting better.,OTHER
2846,lots of features for organizing. i would rate 5 stars if the database didn't miss so often.,BUG
2847,great app to monitor following should add a feature to copy followers that a account follows  not just who follows them. and once you follow or should auto like there last pic,FEATURE
2848,great app  but i miss some features... it's a very good application  i adore it. however  after losing the data on the phone  it will not be restored from the site. would be nice to be able to sync with the site even backwards. would also be nice to see a leader-board inside the app that would also contain the ranks of our friends. still  totally worth buying it  got me addicted to doing squats :),FEATURE
2849,regret buying this app fcs so randomly that it's almost impossible to use it for longer period of time.  lack of updates have made it even more impossible to use.  haven't seen even a single much requested feature by the community being implemented in this app despite being ok play store for more or less 4 months now.  disappointed.,USABILITY
2850,good auto correction but inferior prediction i understand that the intention of this keyboard is not speed like swift key achieves through its prediction algorithm however the level of prediction available should be a little higher this is one main feature i miss the most among a few more minor ones that i hope will be implemented later. but in my opinion from my time using the current version i believe this has potential and is better than a few other keyboards that change the keyboard layout. but it still needs a lot of work to beat swiftkey & swype,FEATURE
2851,best twitter client. period to app is fantastic  the new ui made it on par with other modern apps but which lack features. plume now has it all. the looks and all the functionality you need.,OTHER
2852,lack some features a  list's notification and/or unread tweet's counting.  consume much api when swype between columns.,FEATURE
2853,awesome great ui  wonderful features like swipe to play next and a great eq. i'd like an option to make the default be the volume bar  not ratings.                                                      my only complaint is the profound lack of a remotely viable video player. add this and i'll buy the full version.,FEATURE
2854,needs updates/lack of features this app can get a little more better.,FEATURE
2855,less features. lack of features.you cannot find your poker buddies. should have more features like the web version. and most importantly  i've found a bug  that you have to restart the game in order to refresh leaderboards!,FEATURE
2856,update sux for gs4 i have fun on game just wish there was more things to buy. like a shot of liquor. or rum and coke. pack of cigarettes. a gold lighter. black rose. some thing new. just need some new features for phone versions for androids. can only see 1buddy at a time change it back so i can see all at once. bring back my drinks,FEATURE
2857,request for 5 stars! generally i know what hour it is  how about a minute clock bar instead of a full day clock? also i should be able to put a black line at intervals i want for more precise measures  like every 10%  15%  or 25%. would recommend it to anyone!  what added features come with the unlocked version?,FEATURE
2858,blech. horrible lack of features and customization. good for only occasional typing  i guess.,FEATURE
2859,needs a few upgrades no comma on the main keyboard  and no way to change any colors?  the grey/white/black ui makes it very hard to see selections.  and commas are so important to use  so why not make that key available for the main keyboard?  come on google.. you're awesome at so much... but this one falls flat.  we'll see how accurate it is  and that may be it's best feature.,FEATURE
2860,blech. horrible lack of features and customization. good for only occasional typing  i guess.,FEATURE
2861,would like to see more i have the htc one. i have set the keyboard to display nav arrows so i can move the cursor through text to correct errors. i miss this feature in the google keyboard so have removed it. also i was unable to find a way to calibrate the keyboard to reduce errors etc (htc keyboard has the option)  hope to see this in future updates thanks ;),FEATURE
2862,features and new color theme awful. i really hate the new android color  or lack thereof. the blue was fine  and i'm pretty upset you guys got rid of it. bring back the blue  and the punctuation on long-pressing the period! and why is the keyboard shrinking when i switch to symbols?!,FEATURE
2863,canon pixma solutions hello its an amazing app but still missing some features. can you please add the  black & white color option also print options like settings of how u like to print before you print.? colors options page settings etc etc...... thanks other then that the app is amazing. good job.,FEATURE
2864,a superb app i came to android about a year ago from an iphone  and i tried every reddit client out there such as baconreader and reddit news. these were all good apps  but none of them compared to my experience with alienblue. then  i tried reddit sync and it has become almost exclusively the only way i read redditch anymore. the holo interface and black night mode are easy on my eyes and it has all of the features i need.,OTHER
2865,just great excellent i wish it had the black list feature,FEATURE
2866,could be better nice  and deserve 5 stars but should add sone features like  erase the name  zoom or crop  effect  widget  or splash to hide a name  or to get it fade.,FEATURE
2867,? good features  slow deliveries  and hit and miss notifications.,OTHER
2868,no copy text feature this app is good  but i just wish it would allow me to copy text from pdfs.  sometimes i need to paste text from a pdf document into a word document.  i find this lack of functionality quite frustrating.  if the developers add this feature i would give this app 5 out of 5 stars.,FEATURE
2869,perfect haven't used all its features yet but even just as an ssh client its ahead of the rest. the popup extra keys  don't have to use hackers keyboard to compensate like i did with other apps lack of ctrl keys etc. very polished interface that is great to use and well made. keep it up.,OTHER
2870,like this app... i like this application because it is easy to use and looks great as well.  one feature i miss (in fact i use in conjunction with business calendar) is the contact suggestion from the global address book (corporate account),FEATURE
2871,needs improvement! this app is pretty strange. works great sometimes and sometimes it just doesn't seem to work.  i get a black screen and then the software just hangs. i love it but 5 stars is a stretch. i wish it would just work all the time.  the icons are great and the launcher has lots of good features. if the black screens are sorted  its 5 stars easy.,BUG
2872,good enough to compete with htc sense 5 i like this launcher a lot. it is comparable to the htc sense 5 launcher. imho  i believe that the prime version should at least allow you to use your phone's factory widgets. most importantly  the blinkfeed feature. if you don't plan on unlocking it in prime version  please develop blinkfeed and release it in the next update. i mean  give us a reason to want to purchase the prime version. i did.. but i still miss my factory widgets & blinkfeed.,FEATURE
2873,poor support and lack of common sense you gave away go launcher prime free for 24h back in december 2013. you said it is free  but now all features disappeared and i am prompted to buy it again since latest update.  what happens?,BUG
2874,average somehow i feel like it is still lack of some features,FEATURE
