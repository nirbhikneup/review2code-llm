114,"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)",problem discovery

The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

231,"Update, EN performance has improved considerably (from 2 to 3 stars) since my last review, however the app remains pretty buggy It constantly reports failure to synch, it freezes momentarily between all actions, it crashes here and thee, and the search function sometimes fails to find key words I am borderline thinking of going premium, but also keeping an eye for alternatives Note, some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7

Previous review,
After several months of daily use, and building about 1K pretty intensive notes, I was in the process to put a serious long-term commitment to EN- but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK 

On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week, in terms of less freezes, when trying to do a search- so for me it is wait and see, to see if EN can get it together The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad &amp Mac desktop versions I am still working on EN, but will also be on stand-by, and looking for possible alternatives

I don't have many concerns w the new design, as others do-- but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues",problem discovery

243,"Evernote is an excellent and indispensable service in my life I'm happy to be a premium subscriber

The mobile app, however, seems to be getting progressively worse The latest version is clunky and buggy Not to mention that 'announcements,' which are essentially ads, now occupy the app's prime real estate If there were an extra-premium subscription that would let me hide those and focus on my work, I'd subscribe!

I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration, though, this feature causes a crash Arg!

I'm an Evernote evangelist, but I honestly could not recommend this mobile app

247,It seems Evernote did not understand the spirit of iOS 7 The design seems flat for the sake of flatness Usability has been thrown out the door It's very confusing to use the app Simple actions are painfully slow,problem discovery
248,"Okay Evernote, I hope you are listening You had a great idea But 'note' should not be in your name Call it Eversomething The text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text, bullets, numbered lists, indentation, etc Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting I don't know, but until this is fixed it is not useful And man I've really tried to like Evernote The synching ability among so many platforms was great But I have to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you will read this But I really wish you would understand this huge weakness in your product And I have done a good amount of googling around to know that I'm not the only one around wanting better text capabilities Please fix this I really want  need a proper Evernote!",problem discovery

260,"Seems like the Evernote religion has passed me by Perhaps there are handy tools that I am missing trainings that are obvious to all but me But, really! The notes, bullet points, spacing, numbering all fail when i transfer to Word and other systems The resulting formatting problems take longer than just starting over and retyping notes I also find that the left column flickers and the program crashes at every other use About 1 in 4 syncs give an error message 

All that aside, I like calling up notes on my phone, ipad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want If this problematic version is intended to induce me to go for another version, it doesn't In fact, if this version were more solid, I'd be tempted to buy the upgrade",problem discovery
261,"When this app worked, I'd give it 4 stars But shortly after having it I got several errors about inability to sync And then I couldn't open all my notes And now it says trouble reaching evernote server Btw the solution to that 1 (after I tried reinstalling and rebooting) is to log in using user name instead of email (or vice versa Whatever you're having a problem w try the other) But annoying this happens at all

Every single time I open up the App, it defaults to the 'Updated' view of all my notes Then, when I select either 'Title', which is how I REALLY WANT to organize my notes, in alphabetical order, or I select 'Created,', the App immediately crashes and closes  I have tried this over 50 times! I tried rebooting my iPadno to avail  I tried deleting the App all together, and then reloaded it, but still the same problem!  This HAS TO BE FIXED ASAP PLEASE!!!!!!!  I can't effectively use my notesit's too much of a hassle to try to look in each month for a note created, and even each month is not in alphabetical order  THERE IS NO RYTHME OR REASON TO THIS UPDATE!!!!

Go horseback riding? Come to the historic Centro, where it is mapped but doesn't exist The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house

Next problem, related to this is the 'Near Me' function First, the app couldn't find me Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house

Lastly, the new version is less functional than the previous version And it's a lot less functional than the website

Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed I am definitely unhappy with this version",problem discovery

This game is so tedious to play, it certainly isn't worth the hefty price tag associated with it. If you bought this during the sale; you got a great deal, but as someone who paid full price to support Team 17, I'm disappointed in this lackluster port.

272,Pretty Good!	I give it three stars because there's alot of photo editing apps that already have the same features for free.... you'll get that fifth star whenever the clone effect is added....but it's pretty good but no better than the FREE apps with these same effects..,rating

278,"Good stuff	This app would be better if the draw function had the same beautiful brushes as Line Brush.

318,"The best -- one suggestion	I'd love to see an option for TRUE black and white saves -- not just an option for high-contrast greyscale. That way CCITT compression could be used and the space saving would be dramatic. 90 percent of my scans would be fine in high rez 1 bit.   I've yet to see another app that can save to 1 bit (though they can be read by most PDF viewers), but given storage size concerns, I don't see why scan apps don't include this as an option.   Great job on all the rest though.",rating

One is for my pictures so that when I take a picture, it will instantly be sync'ed to my google cloud account, and then my PC syncs with google cloud, meaning I should never lose a picture.   I also do an occasional sync to my NAS drive as I'm a bit paranoid.  I also sync from my MP3 folder on my NAS account back onto my phone card, so that when I add some new music to my NAS drive, it will sync onto my phone.  Altogether a very useful program.",rating

571,I love how it tests my brain!,rating
572,"You're probably thinking why pay when you can get something similar for free...I thought the same thing and finally ponied up (do you really spend *that* much more/less on a cup of coffee?) and the value it's added on a daily basis is invaluable. Time tables are pretty accurate, but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps, not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you. Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way, and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab. Has saved me so much in time.",rating

579,Great info on Houston restaurants though some restaurant info needs to be updated such as those which have relocated.,rating
580,"The only complaint I have about this app is that unless you live in one of the supported cities, it's pretty much useless. Even if you do live in a big city, the app won't help you at all if you're travelling somewhere smaller, which is why I recommend keeping a backup app like Urbanspoon on your iPhone as a backup.",rating
581,"I bought this app on December 24th. I purchased mainly for hunting and the Google terrain map set. I had issued where the terrain map would not load, and was blacked out. All other maps and features worked fine. I emailed customer support that night around 11pm., and had a response and a solution via email when I checked mail at 9 am, Christmas morning! Now, that's what I would consider excellent support. Seems there was a small issue  with Google terrain maps that only affected purchases on Friday the 23rd, and Saturday the 24th. I am all fixed up now and everything works great!",rating
582,"I use this app almost every weekend while exploring back roads and trails by motorcycle. Functionality is excellent while on the road as well as using the data to review later using Google Earth. 

I've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time. 

I strongly recommend reading the users guide and watching the videos. 10 minutes spent learning the app will really pay off in how much use and function you get out of the app.",rating
583,"I cannot believe how amazing the new changes are. If you mountain bike, hike, camp, or travel this is a must need app! It now tracks altitude, pace, speed, and about every other stat you need in any unit of measure. By far this is the best app I have!",rating

593,Works awesome for me. Have 1200 cellar of mostly older bottles. Scan works a lot but type and search fills in. Really live off this app. love the drink now feature. Use that every week!,rating
594,Better than any other wine app.,rating
595,It is a good app but I eat a lot of home cooked meals and it's hard to find the exact thing I ate.,rating

613,"To those concerned that you cannot zoom in on those savvy charts and reference materials included on this app...you CAN! Let me help. Simply tap on the chart or image itself. This will then immediately bring it up closer in its own page, and then you can get even closer by pinching. Just tap the images first, my friends. This is a great app.",rating

620,I just finished up a weekend of playing and it was the first time I have used this product. I was more than impressed with it! The setlist option was my favorite part. We played several different times throughout the weekend and being able to program the songs into setlist form made it super easy to transition between songs. I highly recommend this product and can't wait to use it again!,rating
621,A must buy.,rating
622,"For the price, it's great. I've been using quicken for 5 years now, but I've switched to this app 2 years ago. My wife and I use the sync option and are now keeping a budge very easily. Awesome app- needs a desktop version!",rating

632,This is an excellent app to use in the daily devotional reading of the mass readings.  Well done!,rating
633,Overall a great app.  I use it daily. It would be helpful if entrance and communion antiphons were included. I do not appreciate the new  in app purchase feature.  The saint of the day should either be included with the program or have a way to remove the buy button for those who do not want to purchase this.,rating
634,What a bargain for all the benefits I receive daily from this app!!  The audio is especially good to have.  Reading (or listening) to the daily Mass readings has been a great help to me.  I also like having the prayers for the start and end my day.  I consider this to be a must-have app for all busy Catholics.,rating
635,Doodle jump is sick. I love it! He's so freaking cute!,rating
637,"I needed a good flash card system for my Mandarin vocabulary, and this is everything I could have asked for.  If never heard of Quizlet before, but by enabling the extended keyboard for pinyin, and my Simplified Chinese keyboard, I was easily able to make a custom list of words.  ? (shu?) on one side, and ""water"" on the other for instance.  Inputting them to this app was super easy!  Very well done and totally worth the $4.  Quizlet is free, by the way.",rating
638,"Pixel for pixel, this scanner does better than an expensive HP printer/scanner. Part of that is the iPhone but the other part is JotNot's software. I use this in my presentations for text off a page. (it doesn't do so well with images though, hence the 4 stars.) taken as a whole, it's money well spent.",rating

670,"I have been using this product for 5 days and I love it.  If you are seeking for an app mainly to write school paper, do basic spreadsheet, and reading PDF articles, this is the one.  Of course, you can't compare to iWork apps because they will definitely beat this app in terms of looks and quality (called great marketing).  But if you are a poor student like me, paying student loans, and are seeking for an app mainly to write papers and read docs, I recommend with this one. I have not tried the PowerPoint yet, so I can't say much about it.",rating
671,I love it,rating

679,Great app. Works on almost any course. No complaints at all.,rating
680,"Overall fantastic.

The UI is a little clunky, and things like tapping in the golf ball icon to measure club distance were a little tough to find. It doesn't look like a button.

Wish I could view the clubs and look at their performance without starting a round.

Statistics could use some work as well. The charts while fairly easy to read seem disjointed. 

Needs a better social aspect.",rating
681,"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",rating
682,"I have used this App for over 8 months, and is by far, the best golf GPS for the money. I had a sky caddie before, and it was not half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual dues GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. 

I have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that. 

Anyway, must have for all serious golfers.",rating
683,This app while not perfect (some songs it doesn't) is very good. I use it severalvtimes a week.,rating

Update to a month and a half later.

721,Very nice-looking app!,rating
722,"My only complaint with this otherwise wonderful app is the absence of any warning for the bottomless ""hole-in-time"" this thing hides. If you are not very careful, you will fall into this hole (which isn't marked in any fashion by a navigation tool that marks everything else) and your family or friends may lose you. Leave a note and tell them where you went, and don't worry, you'll meet thousands of new friends down in that hole! Finally, I wrote/chatted with the guy who wrote this - good man and thanks for this jewel!",rating

I adjust the GPS settings to extend battery life and I can go on epic rides and still have power to text my buddies photos from the trail. I highly recommend it for on the fly trail mapping needs.

888,Great app!!,rating
889,"Works great! Maps are good, better than my Garmin. Default is the lowest cache amount so make sure you turn up the cache amount so you don't find yourself without any maps when you lose service. Make sure you scout your area with the maps you want before hunting so it will cache your map area for when you lose service you still can use your cached maps. Best 5 bucks spent for those who want a good hunting GPS.",rating

891,"The new release shows what a mature iOS app should look like. It performs incredibly well, while offering most features (if not all) that users could want. Not only is it now offered at a lower price, but there is an option to enhance the application with an upgrade. Since few users need the enhancements, it is a great way to offer them.",rating
892,I've been using Marine Traffic for years online and on my iPhone. Downloaded the iPad app and it's as simple (good thing) as always and the content is great. I only give it 4 stars because it needs Retina support which would make it excellent.,rating

903,Great app for viewing weather.,rating
905,It's as accurate as any weather forecaster who gets paid good money for often being 100% wrong. So far this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately so who cares about too much scientific input. I just don't want to be carrying an umbrella when the sun is shining.,rating

918,"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

Keep up the good work!",rating
919,"I have used this on countless occasions now. It has come in handy, and when I do use it the other party is as ""wowd"" as I was the first time. I gave 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky (may be iPhone speech recognitions problems) and because it is a translator it breaks a sentence down funny. But, if you type or talk like a caveman it gets the point across every time. Overall very pleased with this for just a buck!",rating
920,"I am truly amazed at how well this app works..the thing that stands out to me the most is the fact that when I am recording my voice for translation, IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS ME!! I have a very deep voice and I have never had any type of software that was able to take what I said and convert it to the correct version..I am very very very pleased with this app..you should get it ??",rating
922,"The adjustments in Snapseed are very good and it's simple to learn and use. However, I'm not a fan.

952,I wanted an App that would separate my videos from my photo library.  I wanted to be able to play my photo slideshow without interruption from annoying videos.  The music stops and you have to start it over. Now the videos are on this app and I can play right through all my pictures.  Love it!,rating
953,Very nice app,rating
954,Gives hourly weather for the day too!,rating
955,"Does everything I would need a simple weather app to do. Radar is slow to load, but I have another app for that. There's not a lot of detail in the information, particularly in details for upcoming days. The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temp and a picture representation of the weather for the entire day. Nevertheless, this isn't meant to be too detailed, and it provides plenty of info for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often. Sometimes it will load the second time, sometimes it requires a restart of my iPad 3rd generation. It's a nice looking app, the kind that you would want to have on your iPad, it just has a stability problem.",rating

979,Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great. Would love to be able to have main categories and sub-categories. That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand-alone financial management app. Keep up the good work!,rating

A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more.

I really hope you guys upgrade and soon because it's making it pointless for me to be on the site...",rating
1221,"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)",rating
1222,I find this app very useful. It has mechanism and class info that most of the other free programs are missing. You can't do much better (esp for free)!,rating
1223,Great,rating
1224,This app is awesome!,rating
1225,It works perfect for me.,rating

1252,At 47 my eyes are not that good. This really works very well.,rating
1253,Great and useful app. I have nothing bad at all to say about it. It helps me find the best deals on gas around the city with little to no glitches. Does what it's supposed to. 5 stars!,rating
1254,Always completely up to date.,rating

1263,Particularly like the reminder!,rating
1264,Accurate,rating
1265,"Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4, I was able to get it to work three times. And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse. I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the ""dial"" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.

Watched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.

Doesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting.",rating
1266,I absolutely love this app. I scan whatever I see....,rating

1274,This app is so convenient! I looovvve it!!,rating
1275,Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone. One improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier especially on a busy highway. I'd recommend this app to anyone looking for reliable accurate directions.,rating
1276,Awesome! The real deal!,rating
1277,Somehow I lost my contacts. This app got everything back for me,rating

1341,I have made many purchases from FAB and have been mostly very satisfied. The offerings are unique and of good quality. But don't expect your stuff in a hurry as many items are handcrafted.

The objective of hitting 100 is stupid when I don't know how I've done, if I have improved or not when a status on targets hit is not given. 

Tally it up in a drop down much like the distance markers at the end of each target segment.",rating

1420,"This is a finely crafted bubble shooter with great graphics, cute characters, and fun gameplay that merits 4 or 5 stars.

HOWEVER, that is all cancelled out by trying to make you pay real money in order to keep playing. I believe it's 5 turns a day you get for free, so if you lose 5 times you have to either wait a specific amount of time or pay money to keep playing. 

This breaks up the gameplay because I refuse to make in-game payments of this sort. I HATE this type of payment system. I would much rather buy the game up-front for $1, $2, or even $3. If that option becomes available, I would definitely buy this game.",rating

142,"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",feature request
143,"good app, but to make it a great app, video would be a great feature. A must need is to make the timer continuous. After the 5 sec. countdown it would be great for it to restart automatically for continuous self shots. Please add that.",feature request

149,"The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders. But, you are not able to make folders inside folders. I wish you could. The bad things about the last update? Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated. The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard.",feature request
151,"I actually believe this app is totally awesome in helping me prepare for my boards.

I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed myself my list, printed it and was able to give it to doctor. Even the Nurses and Doctors were impressed. 

There is one thing, however, that I think would make this App even better. Add a COMMENT Area so you can write comments regarding yourself or the medications or whatever.",feature request
156,"Great idea for an app and works okay for gas and chain restaurants, but that is literally all you will find. No grocery stores, cafes, or anything that is not fast food or large chains.

170,"Clear has one of the best-designed user interfaces I've ever encountered on the iPhone/iPad. It is the way apps should be. So simple and easy. I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings:

1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices.
2. It needs Reminders and Alerts (and Due Dates, etc.)
3. Some kind of support for longer notes. Right now, single-tapping an item lets you edit the item. Maybe double-tapping should let you open an item's ""detail page"" where you could enter the due date, add an alarm, or type a longer note. 
4. Also, sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists. Though now, I admit this is ""feature creep"" that could detract from Clear's simplicity.",feature request
172,Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great. Would love to be able to have main categories and sub-categories. That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand-alone financial management app. Keep up the good work!,feature request
174,"Ok people...this app works and if you are too stupid to figure out how to make something so simple work, you shouldn't own a smart phone, especially the iPhone.

255,"Thanks, Evernote, for a great app!  I use it DAILY to keep my (gluten-free, dairy-free) recipes organized!

Also, I would love to pay a flat fee to be able to access my notes offline  Thanks",feature request
256,"I would give this 5 stars if it had these two additional features

Ability to use a scroll bar on iPad and iPhone rather than swipe, swipe, swipe and more swipe to get to the bottom of a note 

Ability to keyword search AND GO TO THAT KEYWORD like you can on the laptop version Having search feature for a word does me no good if I can't search within the note to find that word

270,One thing needed	You should be able to have sub-boards  For example You would have the board Food Then on the board food you could have a sub board for dessert Or healthy Our brunch,feature request
271,Love it	Great app  Which there was a way to multi check pins When editing  (deleting or moving to another board) rather than having to do it one at a time,feature request
272,"I've been addicted forever,	The only thing I would change is that over time, I want it more organized so I make another board I wish there was a 'move pin' button to place it to another board current technique is having to repin, then delete it from the old board",feature request

280,Still no ability to change file names - a very basic function Hard to believe after this amount of time Error messages when simply trying to move files No response from dropbox,feature request
281,I hoped the update would bring back the 'open in' option but it didn't Importing files into other apps is a major pain now Why was this option removed? Please bring it back,feature request

284,How to add voice memo from the iPhone?!,feature request
285,This would easily be a 5 star app Best idea ever  But it loses 2 stars just because I have to download one photo at a time This is a huge inconvenience,feature request
287,"Even Google Drive can refresh folders 

Some simple suggestions to increase usability

1 Currently, you have to leave the folder and come back in if you wish to refresh that folder Let me refresh my folder with a refresh button so that I can view changes to files in a more streamlined manner If I am constantly compiling a document on my computer and using my iPad to check that it looks okay or if I am constantly editing a photo and want a high quality, true color representation, then#REFRESH!
2 Refresh Button
3 Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents
4 The air smells a bit Why don't we REFRESH it?
5 It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button
6 Mentos The Refresh Button Maker
7 There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button  Nothing is there at the moment It's lonely
8 Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an F, Give me an R, Give me an E, Give me an S, Give me an H! What does that spell? Easily implementable refresh button with high utility even to people who don't know they need it yet! Yaaay!",feature request
288,This update would be a step up if you could actually see PDF's with it,feature request
289,"When I put things into my dropbox folder on my desktop, I can find files by date modified, by name, etc  The app has an incomprehensible and un-modifyable sorting function  It's almost impossible to find files within the app  Once you find them on your phone, I believe you can 'favorite' them  But the challenge is to find them",feature request
290,Was good until the cent updates Now my notes vanish randomly and I keep getting a sync error This app needs added features too,feature request
291,Some places that had menus on the old version are missing them on the new one Other than that the app is extremely helpful and easy to use  Much improved navigation,feature request
292,"The new update loads slower, closes out on me when i press BACK from viewing photos, this update has glitches I don't like the search method and I wish you guys would make it easier to find RESORTS hotels similar to the ones you previously looked at like if I viewed a few months  ago a 5 star resort with a lazy river it show me similar resorts, I would like to stay at in another place (state,country)",feature request
293,"It is impossible to refine a hotel search for specific criteria beyond location, price and quality Those are well done and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA Especially during peak seasonal flows, many of us travel with pets We have a terrible time finding clean, reliable hotels Most sites for pet travel are woefully inadequate How hard would it be to include this as an additional search filter? That would bring in helpful reviews that would not only enhance the site experience but also improve the field",feature request
294,"Can't get enough	Brilliant app Switched to a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 after an iPhone and noticed the option to switch off timestamps is unavailable on Samsung devices If this could be included in the next update, 5 star rating sorted",feature request
295,"Useful, improved	Happy with the progress on this app but there are many updates that seem to make no change Can't see the names of many boards - there needs to be a wrapped text function on board names so long board names can be seen Indexing is very slow too, many of my pins take weeks to come up in search",feature request
296,"Video playback sucks	This is a wonderful app minus the videos To play one it takes you to an internet browser, then to youtube Please allow for in-app playback to bypass all the nonsense",feature request
1,"Urrrrm	After my third re installing, it finally has scenery. Before hand, it was just black shapes everywhere. I could not even see the walls. This killed my internet as it is a very big game that takes half an hour to install - if you don't like the game, their is no chance of a refund. Once I finally got the proper game, it is very pretty with smooth graphics, an amazing sound track, and some of the best scenery I've ever seen on my tablet. In the next update, I want to be seeing the right installment first time, a chance of a refund, and free roam! Free roam was the best part of the old games, I would love to have it on my tablet! Thank you ?",user experience

3,Best of what's available	I've purchased a few of these word emulator apps and Office Suite is the best. It's very easy to edit with the toolbars. I would give it a five but there are some word spacing issues and I've lost edits occasionally when saving to Dropbox,user experience
4,Finally an Office Suite which works great	I have gone through so many office suite and tried to find the suite which best support most common Microsoft Office suite applications. Finally this suite fills that suite to 80%. If the Font package was part of the suite then I would have given 95% and 5 star.,user experience
5,"Pretty good!	I've edited many photos using this application already. Something to probably address is the photo not always saving what you're looking at in the preview. The beautify tool is a good example of this, as it may look fine in preview, but when you save it, you don't exactly get the same quality. Sometimes it turns out a little pixalated, but overall a remarkable app! I use this in conjunction with other apps.
",user experience
6,"Aside from the occasional glitch, pretty good	Awesome graphics, nice sound, just don't expect AC3 or 4 scale naval warfare. The battles are not what I'd call real time, more a cross between real and turn based. Randomly sailing about is also quite pointless due to being able to fast travel almost anywhere. The main missions and races are fun however as they are much less repetitive than battling. There have been a few bugs but the developer seems to be squashing them quite often.",user experience

I've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time.

72,"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",user experience
73,"I have used this App for over 8 months, and is by far, the best golf GPS for the money. I had a sky caddie before, and it was not half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual dues GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. 

I have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that. 

Anyway, must have for all serious golfers.",user experience

192,It's as accurate as any weather forecaster who gets paid good money for often being 100% wrong. So far this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately so who cares about too much scientific input. I just don't want to be carrying an umbrella when the sun is shining.,user experience

195,"This is a great app. I've used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently 'The Message') when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isn't the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things I've always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I don't always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I don't expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

Keep up the good work!",user experience
196,"I have used this on countless occasions now. It has come in handy, and when I do use it the other party is as ""wowd"" as I was the first time. I gave 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky (may be iPhone speech recognitions problems) and because it is a translator it breaks a sentence down funny. But, if you type or talk like a caveman it gets the point across every time. Overall very pleased with this for just a buck!",user experience

A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more.

and the obvious things like having everything backed up in real-time, and accessibility of my files from anywhere

I could do without it anymore! Remember when we just had computers and hoped they didn't break and lose all our files?

One suggestion if I have automatic photo upload on and download a photo to my phone's camera roll (say, for #TBT), don't automatically re-upload it to Camera Imports! It's already in Dropbox, silly And yes, obviously if I use Instagram or some other photo sharing software to doctor it, I know it's a different photo and will therefore upload",user experience

As a teacher, I rely on having access online &amp off line related to research  for work my work as a teacher  Also, I am required to write notes &amp save them as zip files in order to save space

440,"Evernote is an excellent and indispensable service in my life I'm happy to be a premium subscriber

The mobile app, however, seems to be getting progressively worse The latest version is clunky and buggy Not to mention that 'announcements,' which are essentially ads, now occupy the app's prime real estate If there were an extra-premium subscription that would let me hide those and focus on my work, I'd subscribe!

I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration, though, this feature causes a crash Arg!

I'm an Evernote evangelist, but I honestly could not recommend this mobile app

ORIGINAL REVIEW
Thanks for your hard work Happy to be a premium subscriber

Only suggestion add ability to copy note links",user experience
441,"I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college It's a wonderful service and up until the iOS7 redesign the apps have always worked great 

But the design of this app is terrible  It's jumbled, confusing and lots of advertising for their service add ons and 'news' get in the way of core functionality 

Please redesign the app  Again",user experience
442,"This version still has a marketplace  full of ads I can't hide, and the image attachment only shows me pics from September and earlier So it's pretty useless

Quit trying to sell me stuff and fix your bugs!!!!!",user experience
443,"I am so disappointed to see the turn that the ios app has taken There's so much to dislike about this craptastic abomination that I'm not even going to try 
I'm a long time premium user and am seriously considering other options",user experience
444,"The only reason I moved to iOS7 was to get the newest version of Evernote Let me say, I have no idea what everyone is complaining about Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Handy announcements from Evernote The card view is still there, you just have to (gasp) look for a sec 

If you are having issues, contact support before blasting the app And take a deep breath folks Life isn't that bad",user experience
445,It's a app that you can do pretty much everything from making to do list to office papers It's great for people that are on the go and can store almost anything and have it in the palm of their hand,user experience
446,"The app is missing a few things compared to the computer based version, but overall functionality is pretty good The only reason I don't give the app 5 stars is because the new interface is absolutely ugly Although this is just a personal opinion, I feel that the layout is slightly inconvenient and confusing If this changes, I will give it 5 stars",user experience
447,"I love, love, love Evernote! It is the only way I remember anything Their generous monthly allotment of new storage space is incredible!

The new interface seems to have buried things I want most Such as Sync Now and Search Sync seems to be broken regardless

I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does, using my first sentence 

Another new(?) annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders Again, working like the desktop version would be better here

Finally, it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote, evaluating the entire tag Not just the first word in the tag

The iOS version is a bit buggy but that may be all iOS 7's fault It is the buggiest iOS I can remember

I'm not mad Just frustrated 2 stars is a reflection on the iOS version, not the Evernote across platforms",user experience
448,"The search function isn't working and I have to sign in every time I open it Evernote needs to fix this Other than that, I love Evernote",user experience

454,I loved Evernotesthat is Until I download iOS7 With their new and improved look they also did away with everything you ever had saved  They did however manage to maintain the notebook namesunfortunately all of the notes within those notebooks were erased  I used this app for work and personal businessall files gone!  Be sure to only use this app for unimportant notes  Very disappointed -(,user experience
455,"I have over 200 notes in Evernote (verified in the Mac version and on Evernotecom), but only 4 of them appeared in the new version of this app until I deleted and reinstalled it Logging out and logging back in didn't work The new UI will take some getting used to but feels cleaner and faster than before",user experience

457,"I can't believe you guys removed one of the most useful features of Evernote, which was the ability to style lines as either a section, subsection, paragraph or blockquote That was the only way we could give some hierarchy to our notes

Now all my notes are one dimensional and its impossible to organize my thoughts How could the Evernote team consider that this feature was unnecessary? Do you guys not use your own app? How am I supposed to outline my notes? This is really a big let down to an otherwise great update But it's too big an omission for me too be happy about anything else That's why I give it 2 stars",user experience

Suddenly I am off and running, saving and accessing info on everything from learning disabilities to salad dressings I would like it better if there were multi- layer nesting available for the notebooks, but it is pretty cool 
Btw, I use the skitch add-on for editing,reformatting, *bold* print, etc  It's great",user experience
467,"Evernote is now virtually unusable I was simply trying to toggle check marks in my grocery list yesterday, and it would take three or more attempts to acknowledge me, and then suddenly the keyboard would pop up without any reason and the screen and cursor would jump to the bottom of the list When the program did finally acknowledge me, the check marks would be delayed by about 2 seconds each as if it had to stop and sync between every gesture

Do people even test apps before release any more? Who thought 'Oh, yeah, this looks perfect,' should be fired",user experience

581,"The new (complete rewrite) version is a disappointment  Very slow to no response to photo paging requests, lack of hotel search facility for a given city and incomplete searches for hotels  These are just a few problems I noted on first use of rewritten app  Needs some work  Hopefully there will be an update released soon  This used to be a great app",user experience
582,"I find it an useful tool  It is helpful to read multiple opinions, one can generally wade through the static and determine what fits  It has a vast amount of data, but be careful and glean from other sources to get information Remember it is a tool to help plan and execute your own trip, use many data points and don't look for perfect wisdom  Some people's jewels are NOT others treasures   Of I had to put a &lt  &gt value, I would say about 70% accurate, including my own ratings, I am very picky, some people just want to be out of the rain",user experience

One small issue I have is that when you ask what's near you, or when you use a filter, not everything shows up  An example is that I was trying to find info on a brew pub near our motel  It didn't show up on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location it didn't show up in the search  But, when I searched by name, there was the pub and reviews",user experience
